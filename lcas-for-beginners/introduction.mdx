title: "What is a Life Cycle Assessment?"
description: "An LCA is a standardized way to quantify a product’s environmental impacts across its entire life. It follows the product from cradle to grave and translates complex processes into decision‑ready insights for business."
---

**Plain definition:** Life Cycle Assessment measures the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product or service from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use, and end of life.

**Typical life cycle stages:** Raw materials → Manufacturing → Distribution → Use → End of life

### What LCA helps you answer

- Where are the biggest hotspots across the value chain
- Which materials, suppliers, or processes drive most of the impact
- Whether a design change actually reduces total impact rather than shifting it elsewhere
- How different product options compare on a fair, functional basis
- What role use, maintenance, and end‑of‑life play in the overall footprint

### What LCA is not

- Not only carbon. CO2e is one important indicator, but LCA also considers water use, toxicity, resource depletion, and more
- Not a certification by itself. It produces evidence you can use for declarations and claims
- Not absolute truth. Assumptions and data choices matter, so transparency and review are important

### The building blocks of a good LCA

1. **Goal and scope** define why you are doing the study and how you will use the results
2. **Functional or declared unit** sets the basis for comparison, for example 200 wears of a t‑shirt or 1 kg of product
3. **System boundary and cut‑offs** decide which processes are included, for example packaging, transport, and recycling
4. **Data sources** combine primary data from your operations with quality secondary data from LCA databases
5. **Impact assessment method** converts flows into indicators, for example EF 3.1, ReCiPe, or IPCC for climate
6. **Interpretation and quality checks** include hotspot analysis, sensitivity checks, uncertainty, and external review when needed

### A simple example

Imagine comparing a reusable cup and a single‑use cup. The reusable cup has a higher manufacturing impact but is used many times. Once you divide impacts by the functional unit, for example 200 uses, the per‑use impact can be much lower if the cup is durable, cleaned efficiently, and actually reused. LCA makes this comparison fair and exposes the conditions that matter.

### Why teams use LCA

- **Credible communication** for marketing and sales without greenwashing
- **Design and R&D** to choose better materials, finishes, and suppliers early
- **Procurement and tenders** where EPDs and comparable results are required
- **Risk and compliance** as regulations and digital product data grow
- **Reporting** with defensible, repeatable numbers your stakeholders can trust

### What you get out of it

- A clear hotspot map that shows where to focus effort first
- Comparable results per unit that let you choose the better option
- Input material for Environmental Product Declarations and customer requests
- Evidence and narratives you can reuse across product, marketing, and sales
