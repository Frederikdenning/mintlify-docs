## What is a Life Cycle Assessment?

An LCA is a standardized way to quantify a productâ€™s environmental impacts across its entire life. It turns complex data into clear choices you can act on. Less noise. More signal. Better products.

**Lifecycle at a glance:** Raw materials â†’ Manufacturing â†’ Distribution â†’ Use â†’ End of life

## **Why LCA Matters**

Every product has a hidden story of energy use, emissions, and resource flows. LCA uncovers that story in a structured, comparable way. Instead of looking only at carbon, it also measures effects like water use, toxicity, and resource depletion.

## Key Questions LCA Answers

- Where are the biggest hotspots across the value chain
- Which materials, suppliers, or processes drive most of the impact
- Whether a design change actually reduces total impact rather than shifting it elsewhere
- How different product options compare on a fair, functional basis
- What role use, maintenance, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life play in the overall footprint

## Core Elements of an LCA

1. **Goal and scope** define why you are doing the study and how you will use the results
2. **Functional or declared unit** sets the basis for comparison, for example 200 wears of a tâ€‘shirt or 1 kg of product
3. **System boundary and cutâ€‘offs** decide which processes are included, for example packaging, transport, and recycling
4. **Data sources** combine primary data from your operations with quality secondary data from LCA databases
5. **Impact assessment method** converts flows into indicators, for example EF 3.1, ReCiPe, or IPCC for climate
6. **Interpretation and quality checks** include hotspot analysis, sensitivity checks, uncertainty, and external review when needed

## **Example: Comparing Products With LCA**

> Reusable cup vs. single-use cup ðŸ¥¤

Imagine comparing a reusable cup and a singleâ€‘use cup. The reusable cup has a higher manufacturing impact but is used many times. Once you divide impacts by the functional unit, for example 200 uses, the perâ€‘use impact can be much lower if the cup is durable, cleaned efficiently, and actually reused. LCA makes this comparison fair and exposes the conditions that matter.

## Why Businesses Use LCA

- **Credible communication** for marketing and sales without greenwashing
- **Design and R&D** to choose better materials, finishes, and suppliers early
- **Procurement and tenders** where EPDs and comparable results are required
- **Risk and compliance** as regulations and digital product data grow
- **Reporting** with defensible, repeatable numbers your stakeholders can trust

## What LCA Delivers

- A clear hotspot map that shows where to focus effort first
- Comparable results per unit that let you choose the better option
- Input material for Environmental Product Declarations and customer requests
- Evidence and narratives you can reuse across product, marketing, and sales
