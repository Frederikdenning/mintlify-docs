title: "LCA vs CO2e assessment"
description: "Most impact discussions focus on COâ‚‚e, but quick carbon estimates often rely on weak data and risk â€˜carbon tunnel vision.â€™ Learn why looking beyond COâ‚‚e gives a clearer sustainability picture."

<Card title="CO2e assessment" icon="leaf" color="#ffffff" horizontal>
  Common starting point to size impact. Frequently relies on suboptimal data such as spend data and carries a risk of carbon tunnel vision.
</Card>

<Card title="LCA assessment" icon="leaf" color="#ffffff" horizontal>
  Provides a more holistic view by analyzing impacts across multiple indicators, including effects on human health, the natural environment, and climate.

**Carbon tunnel vision:**                   focusing only on CO2e can miss other material impacts.

## What a full LCA adds (beyond CO2e)

- **Multiâ€‘indicator view** across **human health**, **nature**, and **resource availability** (not just climate)
- **Higher data quality,** combining primary data with reputable LCA databases
- **Fair comparisons** using a **functional unit** (impact per use, not per item)
- **Operational insight**: clear **hotspots** in materials, processes, logistics, energy, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life
- **Credibility** for **declarations** and **public claims** aligned with standards

## Practical insight

Reducing material waste by even a few percentage points in manufacturing has meaningful efficiency, financial, and environmental implications.

## Where LCA drives decisions

- Procurement
- R&D
- Marketing
- Sales
