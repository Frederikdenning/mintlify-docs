title: "LCA vs CO2e assessment"
description: "Because the climate crisis dominates the conversation, impact discussions often center on CO2e. Quick CO2e assessments are commonly used as a starting point to size impact, but they are frequently based on suboptimal data such as spend data and carry a risk of carbon tunnel vision, where only CO2e is considered."

  <Tab title="CO2e assessment">
    Common starting point to size impact. Frequently relies on suboptimal data such as spend data and carries a risk of carbon tunnel vision.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)">
    Provides a more holistic view by analyzing impacts across multiple indicators, including effects on human health, the natural environment, and climate.

**Carbon tunnel vision:** focusing only on CO2e can miss other material impacts.

### What a full LCA adds (beyond CO2e)

- **Multiâ€‘indicator view** across **human health**, **nature**, and **resource availability** (not just climate)
- **Higher data quality,** combining primary data with reputable LCA databases
- **Fair comparisons** using a **functional unit** (impact per use, not per item)
- **Operational insight**: clear **hotspots** in materials, processes, logistics, energy, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life
- **Credibility** for **declarations** and **public claims** aligned with standards

## Practical insight

Reducing material waste by even a few percentage points in manufacturing has meaningful efficiency, financial, and environmental implications.

## Where LCA drives decisions

- Procurement
- R&D
- Marketing
- Sales
