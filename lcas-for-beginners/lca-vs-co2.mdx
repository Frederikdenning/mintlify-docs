title: "LCA vs a simple CO2 assessment"
description: "Carbon is a vital signal, but itâ€™s only one lens. Because climate dominates the conversation, quick CO2e snapshots can create carbon tunnel vision. Theyâ€™re helpful for orientation, yet they often rely on rough data and miss other material impacts."
---

### When a CO2e snapshot is useful

- **Fast screening** to size orders of magnitude internally
- **Progress tracking** on decarbonisation initiatives
- **Early R&D** triage when speed matters more than depth

> _Watch-outs:_ Spend-based or generic carbon factors can underâ€‘ or overâ€‘estimate reality. A single number wonâ€™t reveal tradeâ€‘offs or where impacts move in the system.

### What a full LCA adds (beyond CO2e)

- **Multiâ€‘indicator view** across **human health**, **nature**, and **resource availability** (not just climate)
- **Higher data quality,** combining primary data with reputable LCA databases
- **Fair comparisons** using a **functional unit** (impact per use, not per item)
- **Operational insight**: clear **hotspots** in materials, processes, logistics, energy, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life
- **Credibility** for **declarations** and **public claims** aligned with standards

### Practical difference in decisions

Two products with a similar carbon footprint can still diverge on **toxicity**, **water scarcity**, or **resource depletion**. LCA shows those tradeâ€‘offs so you improve what truly matters, not just the carbon headline.

## Methods at a glance

| Method | Best for                        | Notes                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| IPCC   | Carbon footprint detail         | Climate focus only           |
| EF 3.1 | EU aligned declarations and PEF | 16 indicators, normalization |
| ReCiPe | Balanced view across endpoints  | Research friendly            |

### Rule of thumb

- **Internal pulseâ€‘check?** Start with a CO2e screening.
- **Comparisons, tenders, or claims?** Commission a full LCA and thirdâ€‘party review.

Go beyond carbon.
