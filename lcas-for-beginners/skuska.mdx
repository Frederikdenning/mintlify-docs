# LCA vs a simple CO2e assessment

**Carbon is a vital signal, but it is only one lens.** Because climate dominates the conversation, quick CO2e snapshots can create carbon tunnel vision. They help with orientation, yet they often rely on rough data and miss other material impacts.

\<Tabs\>

  \<Tab title="CO2e snapshot"\>

    Quick orientation for internal decisions. Fast, but limited to climate impacts.

  \</Tab\>

  \<Tab title="Full LCA"\>

    Multi indicator view across people, nature, and resources. Fair comparisons, hotspot analysis, and claim ready results.

  \</Tab\>

## When a CO2e snapshot is useful

- **Fast screening** to size orders of magnitude internally  

- **Progress tracking** on decarbonisation initiatives  

- **Early R&D triage** when speed matters more than depth  

:::warning

**Watch outs:** Spend based or generic factors can misestimate reality. A single number will not reveal trade offs or where impacts move in the system.

:::

## What a full LCA adds

- **Multi indicator view** across **human health**, **nature**, and **resource availability**  

- **Higher data quality** combining primary data with reputable LCA databases  

- **Fair comparisons** using a **functional unit** (impact per use, not per item)  

- **Operational insight:** clear **hotspots** in materials, processes, logistics, energy, and end of life  

- **Credibility** for **declarations** and **public claims** aligned with standards  

\<Details title="Mini example: same CO2e, different impacts"\>

Two bottles show 1.2 kg CO2e each. Bottle A has higher toxicity and water scarcity due to materials and dyes. Bottle B has a slightly higher climate impact in manufacturing but far lower toxicity. Without LCA you miss the trade off and risk burden shifting.

## Methods at a glance

| Method  | Best for                         | Notes                        |

|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|

| IPCC   | Carbon footprint detail          | Climate focus only           |

| EF 3.1 | EU aligned declarations and PEF  | 16 indicators, normalization |

| ReCiPe | Balanced view across endpoints   | Research friendly            |

:::tip

**Rule of thumb:** Internal pulse check → CO2e screening. Comparisons, tenders, or claims → full LCA with third party review.
