## **Why a Unit Matters in LCA**

An LCA is only meaningful if impacts are reported per a clearly defined unit. It answers: **_Impact per what?_**

- Makes LCAs **comparable and credible**.
- Prevents misleading claims by ensuring every result has a **defined basis**.
- Without a unit, numbers like "100 kg COâ‚‚e" are meaningless.

| Aspect          | Functional unit                                   | Declared unit                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| What it defines | The service provided by the product or system     | A reference quantity when the full function is not defined |
| When to use     | Comparing products that deliver the same function | Materials or products where final use is unknown           |
| Basis           | Function, performance, lifespan                   | Mass, volume, piece, area                                  |
| Example         | 200 wears of a t-shirt                            | 1 kg of product, 1 litre of paint                          |

## Simple example ðŸ‘•

Imagine two T-shirts. **T-shirt A** has **20 kg CO2e** from production, **T-shirt B** has **10 kg CO2e**. If you only look at the production phase, B looks better.

The difference is **durability and end of life**: A lasts for **200 washes** and can be **recycled**; B lasts for **50 washes** and goes to **landfill**. Washing emissions are the same, so the use phase is comparable.

If you compare **per function** instead of per item and set the **functional unit** to **200 wears**, you need **four of B** to match the service of one A. That changes the comparison result.

This is why comparative LCAs use a **functional unit**, while **EPD** and **PEF** reporting uses a **declared unit** such as **1 kg**, **1 liter**, or **1 piece**.
