### What LCA data really is

- Datasets are built from **measured elementary flows**: what a process takes from nature and what it emits back.
- New LCA data is **not scraped** from the web and **not generated** by machine learning. It rests on measured reality.

### Why databases feel complex

- Large databases stack up like a **pyramid of processes**. A product sits on top of many upstream steps: materials, energy, transport, equipment, and more. You do not need to master the whole pyramid to use it, but it explains why there are only a few general databases.

### Ecoinvent

- **Proprietary** database founded by Swiss research institutions and maintained by the Ecoinvent Association.
- Known for **transparency in the data hierarchy**, which lets specialists **modify datasets** to reflect real conditions.
- **Geography matters**. Datasets often use a regionâ€™s **electricity mix**. If your process uses a different power source, impacts can shift, so practitioners sometimes **replace parts of a dataset** when they have better data.
- This level of editing is **not possible** with aggregated databases.

### European Footprint database

- Created by the **EU** to make LCA data **freely available** as LCAs move into regulation.
- **Based on existing databases**, including Ecoinvent, Sphera, and others.
- It is **aggregated**, so you cannot fully trace dataset origins or edit them in detail, but access is free.

### At a glanceðŸ“Š

| Database           | Access      | Structure             | What you can do                                                                |
| :----------------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ecoinvent          | Proprietary | Transparent hierarchy | Inspect and **edit** parts of datasets; reflect geography like electricity mix |
| European Footprint | Free        | **Aggregated**        | Use official, accessible data; limited drill down and **no detailed editing**  |

### What to remember as a beginner

- Results rest on **measured flows**.
- **Location and system choices** can change outcomes.
- **Transparent** databases allow fine tuning; **aggregated** ones trade detail for access.
