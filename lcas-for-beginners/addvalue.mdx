<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Communicate with confidence">
    Use verified results to support marketing and sales. This reduces the risk of greenwashing and makes messages clearer and more credible.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Comparative LCAs">
    Compare one product against another, or different versions of the same product. For public claims, results should follow ISO standards and ideally be supported by third-party review.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hotspot analysis">
    Identify the few drivers that create most of the environmental impact and cost. Focus on materials, processes, energy, logistics, or end-of-life.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Design & R&D guidance">
    Test alternative materials, suppliers, or processes early in development. Early choices are cheaper to change and have a bigger effect on both footprint and costs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Details title="Also powerful for procurement and compliance">
  Many public tenders and buyer requests require LCA-based documentation such as Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). A transparent scope, unit, and recognized method make compliance smoother and increase win-rates.

## From insight to action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify top 3 hotspots">
    Map out which materials, suppliers, or processes dominate the footprint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick high-leverage changes">
    Focus on design tweaks, sourcing shifts, packaging or transport optimizations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate and communicate">
    Recalculate, check trade-offs beyond carbon, and prepare claim wording or an EPD.
  </Step>
</Steps>
