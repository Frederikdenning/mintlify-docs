**Why this mattersâœ¨**\
LCAs look at a productâ€™s impact more **holistically** than COâ‚‚e alone. Different methodologies include different sets of categories, but in practice they assess effects on **nature**, **human health**, and **resources**. This is the core reason LCAs give a broader picture than a simple carbon number.

### What most methods cover

- **Nature:** how production and use affect ecosystems.
- **Human health:** potential harm to people across the life cycle.
- **Resources:** pressure on material and energy availability.

### Two common ways youâ€™ll see impact reported

- **EF 3.1 (Environmental Footprint):** an EU method used for European EPDs and PEFs. It assesses \*\*16 indicators \*\*spanning climate, human health, and nature; results include **normalisation and weighting** to help contextualise them.
- **ReCiPe:** widely used in academic work. It expresses results through three clear **endpoints**: **damage to human health**, **damage to ecosystems**, and **damage to resource availability**.

### Making results tangible

Impact categories can feel abstract. ReCiPeâ€™s endpoints make them concreteâ€”showing, for example, **how many species are lost** or **how many years of human life are lost** when producing a product. That framing helps teams understand what the numbers actually mean.

### The takeaway for beginnersðŸ“Œ

- LCAs go **beyond COâ‚‚e**; they aggregate evidence across **nature**, **human health**, and **resources**.
- **EF 3.1** = 16 indicators (with normalisation/weighting) used in EU contexts.
- **ReCiPe** = three endpoints that turn complex results into **understandable** outcomes.
