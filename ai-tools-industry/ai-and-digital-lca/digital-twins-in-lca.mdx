**Digital twins** — dynamic, data-driven replicas of real-world products, buildings, or systems — are transforming how sustainability professionals perform LCAs.  
Instead of relying on static datasets, teams can now simulate the **entire life cycle** of a product in real time, testing design changes, supply chain decisions, and usage patterns before a single prototype is made.

By integrating real-time data from IoT devices, sensors, and connected systems, manufacturers and sustainability teams can model environmental performance as it evolves.  
This enables **continuous monitoring**, **impact forecasting**, and **instant scenario comparison** — unlocking a new generation of proactive sustainability analysis.

## Why Digital Twins Matter for LCA

Traditional LCAs have always been powerful for identifying environmental hotspots, but they capture only a snapshot in time.  
Digital twins change that by enabling **ongoing, data-driven assessments** that evolve with product performance.

Key benefits include:

- **Scenario modeling:** Simulate design, material, and logistics alternatives before production.  
- **Real-time tracking:** Connect IoT data streams to continuously update environmental performance.  
- **Predictive optimization:** Use AI-driven insights to reduce carbon, resource use, and waste during the life cycle.  
- **Data consistency:** Maintain a single source of truth between engineering, operations, and sustainability teams.  
- **Collaboration:** Share and update results across departments instantly for unified decision-making.  

> 💡 **Digital twins + AI-powered LCA = continuous, predictive sustainability management.**

## From Simulation to Decision Support

The power of a digital twin lies not only in simulation but in **decision-making**.  
AI can analyze variations in process data, material inputs, or energy consumption and show how each factor affects overall impact.  
This makes sustainability insights **immediate, traceable, and actionable** — turning data into strategy.

For example:  
- A materials engineer can test a low-carbon alloy and instantly see how it shifts the life cycle footprint.  
- A logistics planner can evaluate shipping routes and fuel choices in real time.  
- A sustainability manager can compare predicted and actual results over time to refine product strategy.
