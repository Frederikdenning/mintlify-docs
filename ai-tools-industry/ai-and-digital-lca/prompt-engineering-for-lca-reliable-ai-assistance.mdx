AI delivers the best results when you **ask with clarity and context**.  
These prompt templates show how to guide AI for data mapping, dataset selection, scenario generation, and result interpretation — so every suggestion stays transparent, auditable, and defensible.

## Ground Rules for Effective Prompts

To get reliable outcomes, include clear parameters and expectations in every request:

- Always specify your **functional unit**, **system boundary**, **geography**, and **reference year**.  
- Ask AI to list its **assumptions** and **alternatives**.  
- Request **checks** for units, regional fit, and missing stages.  
- Keep prompts concise but **rich in context** — short, vague prompts lead to generic or incomplete outputs.

> 💡 **Tip:** Treat AI like a junior analyst — clear instructions and structure yield better results.

## Mapping Prompts (Copy-Ready)

Use these when preparing or harmonizing datasets:

- “Map these columns to LCA flows. FU: 1 product unit. Boundary: cradle-to-gate. Region: EU. Flag any unit conflicts. Columns: [paste table].”  
- “Suggest the top 3 background datasets for ‘EU steel 18/8, 2024’; explain why they fit regionally and technologically.”  
- “Review supplier material names and map them to canonical flow terms; flag uncertainties or missing units.”  

These patterns help AI standardize data while keeping mappings traceable.

## Scenario Prompts

Use structured prompts to explore design or logistics changes:

- “Clone baseline and create three scenarios: (A) +70% recycled steel, (B) truck→train 200 km, (C) product lifetime +5 years. Describe expected impact direction and rationale.”  
- “Model substitution scenario: replace plastic A with bio-based plastic B (same mass). Estimate qualitative change in GWP and resource use.”  
- “Compare 2024 vs 2030 scenario using decarbonized electricity mix; highlight top differences.”  

AI can instantly replicate scenarios, but you remain in control of validation and interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Prompts

Turn raw data into clear communication:

- “Summarize hotspots contributing >80% of climate impact; list two improvement levers with estimated reduction potential; include a short uncertainty note (max 120 words).”  
- “Write an executive summary explaining how transportation and packaging drive results, using non-technical language.”  
- “Create a short paragraph linking hotspot findings to business decisions (procurement, design, or logistics).”  

> 💬 **Sustainly Tip:** Use interpretation prompts to generate first drafts for stakeholder communication — always review for accuracy before sharing externally.

---

## QA / Consistency Prompts

Ensure data quality and completeness before running the model:

- “Check if any life cycle stage is missing versus cradle-to-grave; propose data sources for identified gaps.”  
- “Verify unit consistency (kg/km/kWh); suggest fixes for non-SI inputs.”  
- “Scan for double-counted flows or duplicate processes and recommend corrections.”  
- “List processes with missing regional tags or outdated reference years.”  

These checks prevent small data errors from compounding into large interpretation issues.

## In Sustainly

With **Sustainly**, you don’t need to copy prompts manually — the platform embeds these capabilities into your workflow.  
AI-assisted mapping, built-in consistency checks, and model Q&A features let you ask natural questions like:

- *“What drives most of this impact?”*  
- *“Which dataset is causing the largest uncertainty?”*  
- *“How would a recycled material scenario change this result?”*

All within a **transparent, traceable interface** that keeps human experts in control.

## FAQ

**Can prompts replace expert review?**  
No — they accelerate your work, but professional verification remains essential.  

**What if AI suggests the wrong dataset?**  
Always check the regional and technological fit before approving.  

**Can I save prompts for future use?**  
Yes — in Sustainly, you can store prompt templates as project notes or team runbooks.
