Most LCAs still begin in spreadsheets — slow, fragmented, and difficult to scale.  
**AI is changing that** by automating the repetitive data work that once slowed sustainability progress.

With **Sustainly’s transparent AI copilot**, sustainability teams, students, and SMEs can move from static spreadsheets to dynamic, data-driven insights in minutes.  
AI handles data mapping, consistency checks, and scenario creation — freeing people to focus on insights and decisions that drive impact.

## What AI Actually Does in LCA

AI isn’t here to replace expertise — it’s here to make sustainability faster, clearer, and easier to scale. Sustainly’s AI assists with:

- **Smart data mapping:** Connects supplier data to verified flows and harmonized units.  
- **Process suggestions:** Recommends relevant background datasets based on geography or process type.  
- **Consistency checks:** Flags missing data or inconsistencies before they affect results.  
- **Scenario generation:** Quickly clones models to test material, logistics, or supplier variations.  
- **Guided Q&A:** Ask, *“What drives most of this impact?”* and get a traceable, transparent answer.  

> 💡 **AI at Sustainly = transparency, traceability, and collaboration.**

## What Stays Human

AI accelerates the structure, but sustainability context remains a human responsibility.  
You still define:

- The goal and scope of the study  
- Functional units and system boundaries  
- The interpretation of results  
- The link to business strategy or policy  

Sustainly’s **human-in-the-loop design** ensures experts stay in control — AI simply removes the manual friction.

## Common Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

Automation saves time, but responsibility stays with the analyst. Keep your assessment credible by remembering:

- **Review dataset matches** — confirm that geography and technology are appropriate.  
- **Look beyond carbon** — assess multiple indicators like resources, waste, and pollution.  
- **Document assumptions** — short, structured notes make your work transparent and reusable.  

> ✅ Sustainly’s centralized data system keeps every step traceable and exportable, ensuring collaboration and verification stay simple.
