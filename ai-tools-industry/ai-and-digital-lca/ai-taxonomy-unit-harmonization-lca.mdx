Messy spreadsheets can quietly break sustainability accuracy. “SS 18/8”, “stainless304”, and “steel austenitic” might mean the same thing; kWh and MJ get swapped; distances appear in miles.  
**AI can clean and standardize this chaos in minutes** — harmonizing names, mapping to the right datasets, and fixing units automatically so teams can focus on insight, not cleanup.

  **Sustainly’s transparent AI copilot** makes taxonomy and unit harmonization fast, auditable, and scalable — keeping your sustainability data consistent across projects and teams.

## What To Standardize

- **Taxonomy:** unify material and process names into canonical terms (e.g., “stainless steel 18/8”).  
- **Units:** convert and align measurement systems (g→kg, miles→km, BTU→MJ, L→m³).  
- **Metadata:** ensure regional, temporal, and technology qualifiers are properly defined.  
- **Sources:** differentiate between primary, secondary, reported, or inferred data.

## 5-Step Harmonization Flow

1. **Collect datasets** — from BOMs, utilities, transport, and packaging data.  
2. **Detect conflicts** — find duplicates, mixed units, or missing regional data.  
3. **Suggest canonical terms** — AI proposes matches, and you review or approve.  
4. **Map to background datasets** — ensure regional and technological alignment.  
5. **Lock a dictionary** — create a reusable “golden mapping” applied to future imports.

**In Sustainly:** AI-assisted mapping and automated unit harmonization run instantly; you simply review exceptions to maintain full transparency and control.

## Canonical Dictionary (Starter)

- `stainless 18/8` → `Stainless steel, austenitic 18/8 (EU, 2024)`  
- `cardboard` → `Paperboard, recycled content 80% (EU)`  
- `truck med` → `Transport, freight, 16–32 t, EURO6 (EU)`

Keep this canonical dictionary versioned (JSON/YAML) and reuse it across projects for consistency.

---

## Validation Checks To Enable

- **Unit guardrails:** reject unknown unit strings; enforce SI base units.  
- **Range checks:** ensure plausible energy or material intensity (e.g., 0.1–20 kWh/unit).  
- **Region gates:** restrict or flag datasets outside the target geography.  
- **Completeness:** confirm all modules or stages are represented before assessment.

---

## Handling Edge Cases

- **No exact dataset match:** select the nearest technology and document uncertainty.  
- **Mixed-year data:** normalize to the study year or flag sensitivity.  
- **Supplier synonyms:** maintain an alias list so future imports map automatically.

---

## Audit & Traceability

- Save a **mapping report** — detailing old vs. new names, reasoning, and reviewer notes.  
- Store **unit conversion factors** and their data sources.  
- Maintain an **exceptions log** for verifier or auditor review.

> ✅ Sustainly’s centralized data system ensures every mapping, conversion, and revision stays transparent and reusable across your organization.

## FAQ

**Will AI ever map incorrectly?**  
Occasionally — review regional and technological context before finalizing.

**Do I need to manage databases manually?**  
No. Sustainly’s AI harmonization works across standardized datasets, letting you focus on results rather than configuration.

**How do I keep mappings updated?**  
Version your dictionary and review quarterly — updates apply automatically across imports.
