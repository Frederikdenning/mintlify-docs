Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) used to take weeks — sometimes months.  
Now, thanks to **AI-powered platforms**, you can generate consistent, decision-ready results in hours, without needing to be a data scientist or LCA veteran.

But what does **AI-powered LCA** actually mean? And how does it work in practice?

Let’s unpack how artificial intelligence is reshaping sustainability workflows — from **data collection** to **interpretation and strategy**.

<Info>
  **Sustainly uses transparent AI** to make sustainability data accessible, scalable, and auditable — turning traditional LCAs into collaborative, insight-driven workflows.

## What Makes an LCA Tool “AI-Powered”?

AI in LCA doesn’t replace experts — it automates the repetitive, technical, and time-consuming steps that have long slowed down sustainability teams.  
Think of it as a smart assistant that structures messy data and surfaces insights before you even ask.

AI helps with:

✅ **Auto-filling material and transport data** from product BOMs  
✅ **Mapping supplier information** to emission factors and verified datasets  
✅ **Estimating missing inputs** based on industry benchmarks or prior models  
✅ **Running background modeling** automatically for faster assessments  
✅ **Flagging unit mismatches** or data inconsistencies before results go live  
✅ **Ranking improvement options** based on hotspot analysis and potential reductions  

> 💡 In short, AI helps sustainability teams work faster and with more confidence — while maintaining full control and traceability.

## What AI Can’t (Yet) Do

Even the smartest AI has limits — and that’s a good thing.  
It’s built to assist, not replace, expert reasoning.

🚫 Replace expert judgment or contextual interpretation  
🚫 Understand nuanced business strategies or policy goals  
🚫 Guarantee compliance with every standard — human review is still essential  

Sustainly’s **human-in-the-loop design** ensures every AI suggestion remains editable, transparent, and easy to verify.
