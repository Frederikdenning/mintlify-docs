## 🧱 Why Construction Needs Specialized LCA Tools

The construction sector faces unique sustainability challenges. From heavy material impacts to regional regulations, generic LCA tools often fall short. Specialized platforms are built for this complexity — handling everything from PCR rules to BIM data alignment.

Key reasons the construction industry benefits from dedicated LCA software:

- Product Category Rules (PCRs) vary by material and application  
- EN 15804 and ISO 21930 compliance are essential for EPDs  
- BIM and CAD integration saves hours of manual work  
- Circularity and end-of-life modeling are critical for buildings  
- Verified EPD modules are increasingly required for certification
