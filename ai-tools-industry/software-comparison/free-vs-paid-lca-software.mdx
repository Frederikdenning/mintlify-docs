Starting your first Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and not sure whether to invest in paid software or stick with free tools?

This article explores the real differences between **free and paid LCA software**, helping you choose what fits your needs — whether you’re testing ideas, managing a product portfolio, or reporting for compliance.

## What Counts as “Free” in LCA?

Free LCA options are perfect for exploration, learning, and single-product studies. But they often trade convenience and reliability for flexibility and manual effort.

Here’s what “free” typically includes:

- **Open-source platforms** (e.g., OpenLCA)  
- **Academic licenses** (e.g., SimaPro student editions)  
- **Freemium models** (basic features free, advanced paid)  
- **Custom spreadsheets or scripts** (e.g., Brightway2 in Python)

These are great for testing ideas, learning the basics, or creating early design studies. But they lack automation, collaborative workspaces, and compliance-ready templates — things you’ll need for professional reporting or business-scale assessments.

## Common Free Tools

| Tool                          | Free?         | Notes                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenLCA**                   | ✅             | Modular and flexible; databases often cost extra |
| **Brightway2**                | ✅             | Python-based, highly technical, great for coders |
| **Excel tools**               | ✅             | DIY setups, no standardized structure or traceability |
| **Thinkstep GaBi (academic)** | ✅             | Academic use only; limited access and support |

Free tools give you control and transparency — but not necessarily speed, collaboration, or scalability.

## What You Get With Paid Tools

Paid platforms take LCAs beyond calculation. They help you work faster, ensure data integrity, and create consistent sustainability results across teams and departments.

✅ Verified and regularly updated methods (e.g., EF 3.1, ReCiPe)  
✅ Structured workflows and EPD-ready templates  
✅ Supplier and department collaboration features  
✅ Built-in quality control and automation  
✅ Centralized sustainability data across projects  
✅ Transparent AI assistance and guided modeling  
✅ Dedicated customer support and regular updates  

📌 Paid tools are essential if you’re producing multiple LCAs, reporting under CSRD or ISO standards, or managing supplier data.
