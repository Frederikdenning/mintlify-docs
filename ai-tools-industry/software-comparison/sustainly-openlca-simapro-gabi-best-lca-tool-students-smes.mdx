## 🚀 Where Sustainly Stands Out

**Sustainly** is built for the modern sustainability workflow — where speed, accessibility, and transparency matter as much as precision.  
Its **AI-assisted automation** reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks like data mapping and input harmonization, while the **centralized sustainability hub** allows cross-department collaboration without technical overhead.

It’s particularly effective for small teams that want to scale sustainability data across multiple products without adding complexity.

💡 *Fun fact:* Sustainly is also free for students, supporting education and early-career sustainability professionals.
