**Scope 3 emissions** — the indirect emissions across your supply chain — are the most difficult to measure and the most critical for sustainability reporting.  

For many companies, these emissions make up more than 70% of their total footprint, yet data gaps, supplier variability, and inconsistent formats make accurate modeling nearly impossible without the right tools.

The good news: modern **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** platforms now combine automation, collaboration, and transparent data workflows to help businesses take control of their value chain impacts.

Here’s our expert overview of the **best LCA tools for Scope 3 and supply chain modeling** in 2025.

## 🧭 What Makes a Good Scope 3 LCA Tool?

The best **supply chain emissions software** doesn’t just quantify carbon — it makes collaboration and transparency possible across multiple stakeholders.  

Look for these key capabilities:

✅ Supplier engagement workflows and data requests  
✅ Automated estimation for missing primary data  
✅ Dynamic transport and logistics modeling  
✅ Multi-level visibility across product, site, and portfolio levels  
✅ CSRD, EF 3.1, and Scope 3 category reporting readiness  
✅ AI to handle inconsistencies, conversions, and taxonomy mapping
