## What & Why: LCA Software

### **What is LCA Software?**

LCA software is a tool that tracks a product’s environmental impact across its entire lifecycle—from raw material extraction and manufacturing to usage and disposal. By revealing where resources, energy, and emissions are concentrated, businesses can make smarter, data-driven sustainability decisions.

### **Why is LCA Software Important?**

With sustainability regulations tightening and consumer expectations rising, **LCA software** has become a vital tool for companies committed to reducing their impact. It not only identifies environmental hotspots but also supports eco-design, materials optimization, and regulatory compliance. Conducting LCAs is often necessary for certifications such as Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) or Product Environmental Footprints (PEFs), and for meeting ISO sustainability standards.
