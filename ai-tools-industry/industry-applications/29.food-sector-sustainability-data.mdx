Food production is one of the most resource-intensive sectors globally, responsible for a substantial share of emissions, water use, and land occupation.  
Despite this, many food companies still operate with limited visibility across their value chains, particularly in agriculture and processing — where most environmental pressure occurs.

As new EU regulations move toward stricter labeling and substantiated environmental claims, the ability to quantify product-level impact has become essential for both compliance and competitiveness.

## What lifecycle data uncovers in the food industry

Evaluating a food product’s full footprint requires understanding each stage of its journey from raw ingredient to consumption.  
These stages contribute differently depending on farming practices, processing choices, transport distances, and packaging formats.

| Stage           | Typical Impacts                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌾 Agriculture  | Fertilizers, irrigation, land conversion, livestock emissions |
| 🏭 Processing   | Energy demand, refrigerants, packaging inputs               |
| 🚚 Distribution | Cold-chain operation, transport logistics                  |
| 🍽️ Consumption | Cooking energy, consumer waste                              |
| ♻️ Disposal     | Recycling, composting, or landfill effects                 |

<Info>
  Lifecycle analysis helps companies identify which stages drive the largest environmental burden, supporting focused improvement rather than broad assumptions.

## Why many food companies struggle with structured sustainability assessment

Although large corporations often publish footprint ranges, smaller brands and producers face several obstacles when trying to measure product-level performance.

| Challenge                   | Consequence                                                    |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complex supply chains       | Difficulty tracing ingredient origins or farming practices    |
| High cost of traditional tools | Reliance on consultants or outdated software              |
| Fragmented data sources     | Slow decision cycles and inconsistent environmental metrics   |
| Misinterpretation of generic calculators | Risk of inaccurate claims                        |

These bottlenecks are becoming more costly as regulators, retailers, and consumers expect evidence-based sustainability claims.

## The regulatory shift toward measurable environmental performance

Several upcoming EU initiatives move the food sector toward standardized, data-driven environmental evaluation:

- **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF):** common method for comparing environmental performance across products.  
- **Green Claims Directive:** requires independently verifiable environmental statements.  
- **Sustainable Food System Framework (expected 2025):** anticipated to extend lifecycle-based rules into consumer-facing labels.

Companies that prepare now will be better positioned to meet future requirements and avoid costly redesigns later.

## Why emerging brands can move faster

Smaller producers, food-tech ventures, and challenger brands often have simpler supply chains and shorter development cycles.  
This makes it feasible to embed structured sustainability evaluation directly into product development and sourcing.

| Advantage             | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transparency          | Demonstrate substantiated performance to buyers and consumers   |
| Operational flexibility | Ability to adjust ingredients or suppliers more quickly      |
| Market access         | Meet procurement and export conditions earlier                  |
| Data-driven sourcing  | Select suppliers based on verified environmental performance    |

<Tip>
  With Sustainly, even small teams can calculate product-level environmental impact using their existing ingredient and supplier data — without complex software or external expertise.

## Applying lifecycle data to food product development

### 1. Ingredient comparison  
Assess the environmental difference between various crops, farming systems, or protein sources. This enables evidence-based shifts, such as moving from conventional to regenerative agriculture or comparing dairy to plant-based formulations.

### 2. Packaging evaluation  
Packaging decisions become more reliable when based on comparable environmental data. Companies can weigh options such as glass, cardboard, aluminum, or lighter plastics without relying on assumptions.

### 3. Distribution optimization  
Lifecycle data helps quantify when local sourcing reduces emissions — and when efficient long-distance transport may outperform high-impact regional production.

### 4. Reporting and labeling  
Environmental data supports ESG reporting, B2B procurement requirements, and future EU labeling frameworks.

## How to get started

1. **Define the system boundary** (e.g., farm-to-gate or farm-to-fork).  
2. **Collect core product data** including ingredient quantities, fertilizer use, energy inputs, and packaging materials.  
3. **Establish a consistent method** to ensure comparability across SKUs.  
4. **Use Sustainly** to automate calculations using your supplier and production data.  
5. **Communicate results clearly** with documented, verifiable figures.

## The business value for food producers

| Benefit                  | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verified reporting       | Reliable figures for ESG disclosures and B2B clients            |
| Improved decision-making | Clear evidence for ingredient, energy, and packaging choices    |
| Regulatory preparedness  | Alignment with upcoming EU requirements                         |
| Continuous improvement   | Ability to track reductions over time across multiple products  |

## Conclusion: Environmental performance is becoming a core part of food product strategy

As food companies face stricter regulations and rising expectations for transparency, robust environmental evaluation is no longer optional.  
Lifecycle-based assessment provides the clarity needed to design lower-impact products, select responsible suppliers, and communicate claims responsibly.
