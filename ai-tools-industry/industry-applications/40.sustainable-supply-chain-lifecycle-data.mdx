> 💬 “You can’t manage what you can’t measure — and in supply chains, measurement starts with lifecycle data.”

For most companies, **supply chains account for 70–90% of total emissions** — especially Scope 3, which includes upstream suppliers and materials.  
Yet many organizations still lack the visibility to identify where those impacts come from, or how to reduce them effectively.

**Lifecycle data** — powered by tools like Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) — is changing that.  
It gives supply chain teams the transparency they need to make smarter sourcing decisions, comply with evolving regulations, and drive measurable improvements across the value chain.

## Why supply chain leaders are rethinking sustainability

Traditional procurement goals like price and delivery time are no longer enough.  
New regulations like the **EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)** and **CSRD** now require environmental performance across every supplier relationship — not just internal operations.

Lifecycle-based tools help supply chain professionals:
- Quantify **Scope 3 emissions** across suppliers and materials  
- Compare environmental performance between suppliers  
- Prove compliance with **auditable impact data**  
- Prioritize sustainability without sacrificing performance  

| Supply Chain Challenge       | Lifecycle Data Benefit                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| No visibility into emissions | Quantifies product- and supplier-level impact    |
| Rising compliance demands    | Aligns with EN 15804, ISO 14044, and CSRD        |
| Hard to compare suppliers    | Uses verified metrics for consistent evaluation  |
| Unclear ROI on sustainability | Links footprint reduction to cost and risk savings |

<Callout icon="globe" color="#22C55E">
  According to the World Economic Forum, improving supply chain sustainability can cut global emissions by up to **40%** — if supported by product-level data.

## How lifecycle intelligence strengthens supply chains

### 1. **Full value chain visibility**
Lifecycle analysis tracks environmental impact across raw materials, transport, production, and end-of-life — turning assumptions into facts.

With this insight, companies can:
- Identify upstream and downstream emissions hotspots  
- Focus procurement efforts on high-impact categories  
- Build a more accurate Scope 3 reporting baseline  

> ⚙️ A recent Deloitte study found that companies using product-level data improved carbon accounting accuracy by 32% over spend-based estimates.

---

### 2. **Smarter supplier decisions**
Lifecycle data makes it possible to move from cost-only selection to impact-aware procurement.

Teams can:
- Compare materials and suppliers using verified data  
- Require documentation like EPDs (Environmental Product Declarations)  
- Set impact KPIs in contracts, alongside price and delivery targets  

| Metric                  | Supplier A | Supplier B |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|
| CO₂e per unit           | 9.8 kg     | 5.6 kg     |
| % Recycled content      | 10%        | 35%        |
| Energy use (MJ/kg)      | 42         | 29         |

> Suppliers who provide lifecycle data are more likely to win business under sustainability-linked procurement.

### 3. **Compliance without complexity**
New regulations are placing accountability squarely on supply chain leaders.  
Lifecycle assessments provide the verified documentation needed to comply with:

- **CSRD** (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)  
- **CSDDD** (EU Due Diligence Directive)  
- **ISO 14044**, **EN 15804**, and other lifecycle standards  

<Callout icon="shield-check" color="#22C55E">
  Lifecycle data turns compliance from a reporting task into a business advantage — backed by audit-ready metrics.
</Callout>

> 60% of EU public tenders now require sustainability data that references lifecycle performance.

### 4. **Cost, waste, and risk optimization**
Sustainability and efficiency are often aligned.  
Lifecycle analysis helps supply chain teams:

- Spot inefficiencies in materials or transport routes  
- Reduce excess packaging and improve reuse  
- Evaluate carbon taxes and long-term supply risks  

> 💬 “When the same dataset drives both emissions reduction and cost savings, sustainability becomes a performance lever.”

## 5 steps to get started with lifecycle analysis in supply chains

1. **Map key inputs**  
   Identify your most material suppliers, components, and categories.

2. **Collect basic data**  
   Start with available metrics: material weights, energy use, transport modes.

3. **Engage suppliers**  
   Ask for EPDs, emissions disclosures, or run joint lifecycle assessments.

4. **Prioritize actions**  
   Focus on high-impact opportunities: materials, freight, or packaging.

5. **Report and iterate**  
   Feed results into CSRD or ESG reports and update regularly as the supply chain evolves.

## Key KPIs for sustainable procurement teams

| KPI                                 | What It Tracks                          |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| % of suppliers with verified data   | Measures supply chain transparency       |
| Avg. CO₂e per input category        | Benchmarks material- and supplier-level impact |
| Scope 3 coverage rate               | Progress toward full value chain visibility |
| % spend aligned with low-impact sources | Tracks sustainability-aligned procurement |
| Supplier improvement rate (YoY)    | Measures sustainability engagement success |

## FAQs — Lifecycle data in supply chain strategy

**Q: Do suppliers need to run their own LCAs?**  
Not always — Sustainly helps companies build lifecycle models using available data, even if suppliers don’t have full reports yet.

**Q: How is this different from traditional ESG supplier ratings?**  
LCAs offer quantitative, product-specific data — not broad ESG scores — making them far more actionable for procurement.

**Q: Is this suitable for SMEs with limited resources?**  
Yes — Sustainly is designed to be fast, affordable, and easy to use, even for companies with small teams or limited data.
