### Why construction supply chains are under pressure

The building industry depends on long, fragmented supply networks — from raw materials and prefabricated parts to transport and on-site assembly.  
As environmental performance becomes a contractual and regulatory requirement, **supply chain departments are now expected to track not just cost and timing, but the footprint behind every delivery**.  

That’s where **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** becomes valuable. It gives supply chain managers a way to see where environmental impact is concentrated, and to base supplier and material decisions on verified, comparable data.

## 1. LCAs make material and supplier impacts visible

In construction, most emissions and resource use occur before the building even exists — during extraction, manufacturing, and transport of materials.  
An LCA traces these impacts across suppliers and production stages, making them visible in a structured, measurable way.  

This allows supply chain teams to:
- Compare products and suppliers on environmental as well as financial terms.  
- Identify materials with high embodied carbon or resource intensity.  
- Support purchasing with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) that come directly from LCA data.  

> LCAs make “sustainable sourcing” something that can actually be measured and verified.

## 2. They support better procurement documentation

Public and private projects increasingly ask for verified environmental data in tender submissions.  
Supply chain teams that can document material impacts with LCA-based information are better prepared for these requirements.

Typical uses include:
- Submitting supplier EPDs to meet EN 15804 standards.  
- Providing verified CO₂ and material use data in bids.  
- Demonstrating transparent material selection for green building certifications.  

Procurement teams can build stronger cases when every material in a supply chain has traceable, verified data behind it.

## 3. LCAs improve supplier collaboration

LCAs create a shared frame of reference between builders, material producers, and logistics providers.  
When suppliers use LCA results to describe their products, communication becomes clearer — less about marketing claims and more about real performance numbers.  

This shared data helps:
- Align sustainability goals across the value chain.  
- Encourage suppliers to improve their own material efficiency.  
- Streamline reporting and reduce data gaps between partners.  

Instead of asking suppliers for general sustainability promises, the supply chain team can ask for measurable, standardized data.

## 4. LCAs strengthen compliance and audit readiness

Regulations in the building sector increasingly expect transparent accounting of carbon and resource use.  
By integrating LCAs into supply chain operations, companies can maintain a verifiable record of environmental data that supports:

- EN 15804 EPD submissions  
- EU Taxonomy alignment  
- Company-level ESG or CSRD reporting  

For supply chain departments, this means less time spent collecting scattered data and fewer compliance surprises at project closeout.

## 5. They connect environmental data with logistics and cost

LCAs don’t replace existing supply chain metrics — they add context.  
When carbon and resource data are tracked alongside cost and delivery data, the department can evaluate trade-offs more clearly.  

Examples of practical use:
- Choosing transport routes or packaging options based on total lifecycle impact.  
- Comparing two concrete mixes not only by price, but by verified embodied carbon.  
- Including end-of-life or recyclability impacts in supplier selection.  

The result is a more complete picture of what “efficiency” means in modern construction.

## How Sustainly supports supply chain teams

Sustainly’s platform helps construction supply chains integrate verified LCA data directly into procurement and reporting workflows.  
Teams can collect supplier information, compare environmental performance, and export project-ready documentation — all from one interface.

| Capability | Benefit |
|-------------|----------|
| Automated LCA generation | Quick, standardized data for materials and suppliers. |
| EPD workflow support | Easy export of EN 15804-compliant documentation. |
| Integration with procurement tools | Environmental and cost data in one view. |
| Collaboration features | Shared dashboards for suppliers and project partners. |

Supply chain professionals can use this data to respond to tenders faster and manage supplier networks with transparency built in.

### Key takeaway

In construction, supply chain performance now includes environmental responsibility.  
LCAs give procurement and logistics teams a practical, data-driven way to measure and improve that performance — without adding unnecessary complexity.  

They turn sustainability requirements into actionable information, helping supply chains become more transparent, compliant, and efficient at the same time.

> **In short:** LCAs don’t just describe impact — they give supply chain teams the evidence to make better decisions every day.
