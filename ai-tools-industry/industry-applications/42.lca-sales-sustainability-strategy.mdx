## Sustainability Is Now Part of the Sales Equation

In construction and manufacturing, sustainability is no longer just a compliance checkbox — it's a **buying criterion**.  
Procurement teams increasingly ask questions like:

- *Can you provide an EPD with this quote?*  
- *How does your product’s carbon footprint compare?*  
- *Is your material verified under EN 15804 or EF 3.1?*

Sales reps who can answer instantly — with data, not delays — gain a decisive edge.

  LCA-backed sales proposals aren't just competitive — they’re becoming mandatory in public and private tenders across Europe.

## What LCA Really Means for Sales

A **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** calculates a product’s environmental footprint from raw material to end-of-life.  
For the sales team, this means:

- 📊 **Measurable advantage** over vague sustainability claims  
- 🧾 **Compliance support** for EPDs and tenders  
- 💬 **Confidence** during client conversations  
- 💡 **Justification** for premium pricing through proven performance  

> “This board has 27% less embodied carbon than the industry average” is stronger than “we make green products.”
