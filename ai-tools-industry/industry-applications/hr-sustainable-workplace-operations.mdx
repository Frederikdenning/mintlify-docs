Human resources teams influence far more of an organisation’s environmental footprint than typically assumed.  
Office design choices, supplier contracts, digital systems, and employee services all carry measurable impacts related to materials, energy, waste, and procurement practices.  
Using structured environmental data, HR can make these areas more sustainable while strengthening culture, transparency, and operational efficiency.

## Understanding the scope of HR-managed environmental impact

Even without involvement in construction sites or material procurement, HR oversees a range of decisions that shape environmental performance:

| HR Area | Example Impact | Opportunity for Improvement |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Office design & fit-out | Furniture, flooring, lighting, HVAC | Specify lower-impact materials and products with verified documentation |
| HR platforms & payroll tech | Data centre energy use, device turnover | Select vendors with clear sustainability commitments and end-of-life processes |
| Workplace services | Catering, cleaning, waste, commuting | Integrate sustainability criteria into service contracts |
| Employee equipment | Laptop and monitor procurement | Opt for durable, repairable, or refurbished hardware |

Many organisations find that administrative and office-related activities account for a sizable share of operational emissions, making them an important area for structured improvement.

## How environmental data supports HR decision-making

Using lifecycle-based environmental data allows HR teams to evaluate their choices holistically rather than focusing only on direct costs or operational convenience.

Data supports HR in:

- Making procurement decisions that reflect long-term sustainability performance  
- Communicating verified environmental achievements to employees and candidates  
- Strengthening internal accountability by requiring vendors to provide transparent documentation  
- Creating engagement programs that connect everyday actions with measurable outcomes  

Clear evidence of environmental performance helps HR translate sustainability from policy statements into practical workplace actions.

## Key applications for HR in daily operations

### 1. Office design and refurbishment  
Office updates are one of HR’s most impactful areas.  
Using environmental data, HR can:

- Evaluate alternative materials and layouts  
- Select furniture with documented lower-impact profiles  
- Plan modular or reuse-oriented layouts that extend lifetime use  
- Establish measurable performance targets, such as reduced material footprint per square metre  

Sustainability documentation can be used during procurement to compare proposals on more than price alone.

---

### 2. Digital HR systems and payroll operations  

Digital operations have real energy and hardware impacts.  
HR teams can:

- Request transparency on data centre energy sources  
- Include environmental performance in RFP criteria  
- Compare vendors based on their device lifecycle and energy practices  
- Set expectations for reduction over multi-year contracts  

Even “paperless” systems involve infrastructure; understanding that footprint helps HR choose more responsible partners.

---

### 3. Workplace services and vendor management  
Services such as cleaning, catering, and waste handling carry significant upstream impacts.

HR can:

- Request documentation from suppliers to support sustainability comparisons  
- Include environmental requirements directly in service agreements  
- Assess transport, packaging, and waste implications of service options  
- Track supplier compliance through structured data and regular reviews  

This turns service procurement into a lever for measurable improvement.

---

### 4. Employee equipment and device lifecycles  

Procurement of IT equipment affects waste generation, repair cycles, and resource use.

HR can:

- Prefer devices with lower-impact production and longer repairability  
- Compare equipment options using lifecycle metrics  
- Implement reuse or trade-in schemes to reduce material turnover  
- Communicate progress to employees to reinforce sustainable behaviour  

Making device choices transparent encourages responsible use and disposal.

## A practical four-phase approach for HR

| Phase | Objective | HR Action |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **1. Overview** | Identify environmental hotspots in HR operations | Map office, digital systems, and service contracts |
| **2. Evaluation** | Establish baseline performance | Use supplier documentation or platform-based assessment |
| **3. Implementation** | Introduce measurable sustainability criteria | Update procurement templates and KPIs |
| **4. Engagement** | Maintain visibility and participation | Share progress with employees and recognise contributions |

<Tip>Begin with a single category—such as office furniture—before expanding to digital systems or workplace services.</Tip>

Its transparent AI support, scalable workflows, and shared data structure allow HR to integrate sustainability into procurement, onboarding, and operations without adding technical complexity.

| Capability | Benefit for HR |
|------------|----------------|
| Transparent AI support | Makes environmental performance understandable across departments |
| Scalable evaluation | Enables consistent assessment for offices, services, and equipment |
| Centralised sustainability data | Shared access for HR, procurement, and sustainability teams |
| Collaboration features | Simplifies documentation flow and decision-making |

This structure helps HR embed sustainability into daily operations while maintaining clarity and consistency.

## Common challenges and practical solutions

| Challenge | Consequence | Solution |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Sustainability treated as a facilities-only topic | Missed improvement potential | Include HR early in design and procurement processes |
| Limited visibility into digital emissions | Incomplete footprint assessments | Request lifecycle information from HR technology vendors |
| One-time improvement campaigns | Gains do not persist | Integrate recurring KPIs into planning cycles |
| Overly complex communication | Low engagement | Use simple, measurable indicators and shared dashboards |

---

## Useful metrics HR can adopt

- Material footprint per square metre for office projects  
- Percentage of HR-managed suppliers providing environmental documentation  
- Year-over-year change in digital operations footprint  
- Share of employee equipment reused or recycled  
- Reduction in commuting-related emissions from policy updates  

These metrics help demonstrate progress using consistent, repeatable methods.
