> 🌍 Many industries claim sustainability leadership — but without LCAs, it’s just talk.  
> **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** remains the gold standard for quantifying environmental impact. Yet, many sectors still underuse it — missing out on vital data that drives competitiveness, compliance, and climate credibility.

## What Is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)?

A **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** quantifies the environmental impact of a product or service — from raw material extraction to disposal. It provides objective, science-backed data on energy use, emissions, water consumption, waste, and more.

Although widely adopted in industries like manufacturing and construction, **many others have yet to embed LCAs into daily operations** — even when their environmental impact is significant.

LCA adoption is rising — but not evenly. Industries like tech, fashion, and logistics are still catching up, even as climate reporting and buyer expectations accelerate.

## Why Some Industries Still Avoid LCAs

| Barrier | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|
| 💰 **Cost concerns** | Legacy LCA software is expensive and complex. |
| ⏱️ **Perceived effort** | Manual data collection slows adoption. |
| 🧩 **Tech limitations** | Lack of integration with ERP or PLM tools. |
| 🤝 **Low awareness** | Teams don’t know that modern tools solve these issues. |

That’s changing with tools like **Sustainly**, which automate data modeling, simplify reporting, and make LCAs accessible even for non-experts.

## Industries That Should Move Faster

### 1. **Fashion & Textiles**  
Despite enormous footprints — water use, microplastics, and landfill waste — fashion still lacks product-level transparency. Most “sustainable” claims rely on averages, not actual data.

> LCAs expose which materials and processes drive impact — from cotton to chemical dyes — and help build verifiable circularity strategies.

<Tip>Use Sustainly to run small-scale LCAs on top-selling product lines — comparing organic, recycled, or synthetic options.</Tip>

---

### 2. **Technology & Electronics**  
Devices and servers may run on green energy, but their materials and manufacturing still carry a heavy hidden impact. Most tech firms only report Scope 1 and 2 emissions — ignoring the supply chain entirely.

> Lifecycle data highlights where resource extraction, component sourcing, or end-of-life handling create environmental risk.

---

### 3. **Food & Beverage**  
From farming methods to cold-chain logistics, food has a complex footprint. Yet most companies publish category-level averages rather than real, SKU-specific emissions.

> LCAs help producers understand how sourcing, processing, and packaging shift the true impact of similar-looking products.

<Callout icon="leaf" color="#22C55E">
Sustainly lets food brands generate thousands of automated LCAs from ingredient and supplier data — ideal for carbon labeling and buyer reporting.

---

### 4. **Logistics & E-Commerce**  
Transport, warehousing, returns, and packaging each add measurable emissions — yet very few logistics providers use LCAs to optimize environmental performance.

> Lifecycle data can improve packaging design, transport routes, and energy choices at the warehouse level.

---

### 5. **Finance & Investment**  
Banks and funds are pushing green finance — but rarely use lifecycle metrics to assess the actual sustainability of financed products or portfolios.

> LCAs give investors a credible way to connect capital decisions to real, quantifiable product-level impact.

---

## How These Industries Can Catch Up

1. **Automate data gathering** — no more spreadsheets. Use tools like **Sustainly** to extract product, packaging, or transport data directly.  
2. **Start with your top 10 SKUs or services** — identify real hotspots.  
3. **Connect impact to purchasing or design tools** — link LCA metrics to decision points.  
4. **Prepare for green claims rules** — regulations in the EU will demand LCA-based evidence soon.  
5. **Share results** — buyers, investors, and regulators want verified numbers, not estimates.

## Misconception: “LCAs Are Just for Big Manufacturers”

Not anymore.  
Cloud-based platforms make it easy for any team — in any sector — to measure impact without needing deep expertise.

| What You Need | How Sustainly Helps |
|---------------|----------------------|
| ⚙️ Fast results | Prebuilt templates + AI modeling = ready in minutes |
| 🔐 Verified methods | Includes EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, EN 15804, ReCiPe 2016 |
| 🔄 Easy integrations | Connects with ERP, PLM, and APIs |
| 🎓 Flexible access | Teams, consultants, and students all supported |
| 💡 Low cost | Pay only for what you use — no large setup fees |

## Final Takeaway: You Can’t Improve What You Don’t Measure

Lifecycle data is becoming non-negotiable. Whether you design, build, grow, or ship — environmental performance is only credible if it’s measured.

Industries that still avoid LCAs aren’t saving money — they’re delaying what’s now inevitable: transparent, data-driven sustainability.
