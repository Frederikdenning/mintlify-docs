> 💬 “In a world of stricter ESG rules, the safest legal strategy is evidence.”

Legal teams now sit at the center of corporate sustainability.  
Regulators, investors, and consumers expect every environmental claim — from a product sheet to an ESG report — to be grounded in verifiable data.  

This shift makes **transparent sustainability metrics** essential for legal departments managing risk, disclosure, and compliance.  
Lifecycle-based data gives lawyers what they need most: **clarity, traceability, and proof**.

## Why legal teams can no longer ignore sustainability data

The legal landscape around sustainability has changed dramatically.  
New EU frameworks — including the **Green Claims Directive**, **CSRD**, and due diligence legislation — require companies to substantiate environmental statements with recognized, quantifiable evidence.

Sustainability data enables legal teams to:

- Verify the accuracy of environmental marketing  
- Reduce exposure to greenwashing claims  
- Prepare defensible ESG disclosures  
- Strengthen contractual obligations with suppliers  
- Support regulatory reporting with traceable evidence

  The difference between a compliant claim and a costly one is the quality of the data behind it.

## Where sustainability data mitigates legal risk

### 1. **Regulatory compliance with evolving EU rules**

Modern sustainability laws expect companies to show not just intention but proof.  
Lifecycle‑based data supports compliance with:

- CSRD environmental reporting requirements  
- The EU Green Claims Directive  
- Procurement rules requiring verified impact data  
- Sector-specific disclosure expectations  

Legal teams can rely on these metrics to validate marketing, procurement, and investor-facing information — reducing risk long before audits happen.

---

### 2. **Protecting the company from greenwashing claims**

Regulators across Europe are cracking down on unverified sustainability statements.  
Data-driven evidence helps legal teams ensure that:

- Marketing claims match measurable reality  
- Investor presentations use consistent figures  
- Product-level environmental benefits can be defended publicly  
- Supplier information holds up under due diligence  

<Info>
  A claim backed by traceable sustainability data is a claim that can withstand scrutiny — in public or in court.

### 3. **Environmental due diligence in supplier and M&A processes**

Sustainability is now a material factor in acquisitions, supplier onboarding, and long-term contracts.  
Transparent data helps legal teams:

- Evaluate environmental liabilities before deals close  
- Compare suppliers using consistent performance metrics  
- Set measurable KPIs in contracts  
- Document responsibilities across the value chain  

This reduces the risk that hidden environmental issues turn into future financial or reputational losses.

---

### 4. **Strengthening ESG reporting and audit readiness**

ESG reports increasingly require evidence-based environmental metrics.  
Legal teams use lifecycle-aligned data to:

- Validate Scope 1–3 emissions figures  
- Ensure consistency between ESG, annual, and marketing reports  
- Produce audit-ready documentation  
- Support transparent disclosures under CSRD  

It transforms ESG reporting from a narrative exercise into a defensible, data-backed process.
