> 💬 “Winning a tender today isn’t about the lowest price — it’s about the lowest footprint per euro.”

Finance departments in construction can use **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** as a hidden profit driver.  
When sustainability metrics enter bid scoring and public procurement rules, finance teams equipped with verified LCA data can **price smarter, win faster, and protect profit margins.**

---

## The new tender reality
Public and private clients now demand measurable sustainability performance.  
Tenders often assign **10–30% of scoring** to environmental criteria like embodied carbon or energy footprint.  
That means the finance department — not just project managers — must integrate LCA data into cost planning and bid models.

> 💡 **Tip:** Treat carbon like currency — every tonne avoided is both a cost saving and a scoring advantage.

## 3 ways LCAs create financial advantage in bidding
### 1. **Smarter pricing**
By linking carbon and cost, finance can calculate a **carbon-adjusted bid price**, reducing exposure to future taxes and sustainability penalties.

### 2. **Tender scoring boost**
Including verified LCA or EPD data instantly improves evaluation points under EN 15804-aligned frameworks — especially for infrastructure and public housing.

### 3. **Margin protection**
LCAs highlight material and process inefficiencies early, preventing last-minute overruns and helping finance avoid low-margin “greenwashed” projects.

| Benefit | Example Metric |
|----------|----------------|
| Lower risk exposure | % of tenders submitted with full LCA documentation |
| Improved scoring | Average environmental rating vs. competitors |
| Protected profit | Average margin variance on verified LCA projects |
