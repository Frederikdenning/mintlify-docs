<Info>
  Every shipment has a story — lifecycle metrics help you read between the routes.
</Info>

Logistics is one of the most visible yet least measured parts of a company’s environmental footprint.  
Transport networks are complex, often outsourced, and difficult to trace — making emissions and inefficiencies easy to overlook.

That’s changing fast.  
**Lifecycle metrics** — traditionally reserved for product design — are now giving logistics teams the tools to quantify their real-world impact across transport, packaging, warehousing, and return loops.  
With platforms like **Sustainly**, it’s now possible to build sustainable logistics strategies powered by **data, not estimates**.

---

## 1. Logistics needs better visibility

Most logistics teams focus on cost and speed — sustainability only enters the picture after decisions are made.  
But today’s supply chains are under pressure to prove their environmental performance. Common blind spots include:

- Fragmented data from carriers or 3PLs  
- No insight into fuel type, vehicle lifecycle, or energy mix  
- Packaging waste and return flows unaccounted for  
- Reporting based on general averages, not real shipment data

> Lifecycle metrics give logistics teams the full picture — not just how fast goods move, but how sustainably.

## 2. What standard carbon tracking leaves out

Traditional emissions tools often focus only on **tailpipe emissions**.  
Lifecycle analysis expands the scope to reflect the full environmental cost of logistics operations, including:

- Transport vehicle production and maintenance  
- Infrastructure impacts (warehouses, terminals)  
- Fuel source and energy efficiency  
- Packaging materials and disposal  
- End-of-life impact of logistics equipment

| Impact Category               | Standard Tracking | Lifecycle Metrics |
|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Vehicle emissions (Scope 1)  | ✅                 | ✅                 |
| Vehicle manufacturing        | ❌                 | ✅                 |
| Fuel production              | ⚠️                | ✅                 |
| Packaging and reuse systems  | ❌                 | ✅                 |
| Warehousing energy use       | ❌                 | ✅                 |

With this view, teams can rethink everything from packaging formats to route planning — making **smarter trade-offs** between speed, cost, and impact.

## 3. From transport chains to lifecycle systems

Viewing logistics through a lifecycle lens enables a shift in mindset — from fragmented execution to strategic planning.

These capabilities don’t just support reporting — they **unlock new ways to optimize** across the entire logistics operation.

## 4. Real-world applications for logistics teams

### Choose smarter transport modes  
Instead of defaulting to road or air, logistics teams can use lifecycle metrics to justify switching to lower-impact options like rail or hybrid fleets.

### Rethink packaging strategies  
Understand how different materials — cardboard, recycled plastic, reusable crates — perform across the entire lifecycle, not just per shipment.

### Evaluate logistics partners with impact in mind  
Go beyond delivery performance. Request lifecycle data from carriers and suppliers to inform procurement decisions.

### Make warehouses part of the solution  
Incorporate energy use and infrastructure materials into logistics planning — aligning operational efficiency with sustainability goals.

## 5. Why now? Regulatory and customer pressure is rising

Sustainability regulations and procurement standards are tightening across global supply chains.  
Lifecycle reporting is already becoming essential under:

- **EU CSRD** (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)  
- **ISO 14083** for transport emissions reporting  
- **GHG Protocol Scope 3** value chain disclosures  
- Green public procurement and corporate RFPs

> What was once “nice-to-have” is now a **compliance requirement and competitive differentiator**.

## 7. Rethinking logistics with measurable impact

| Old Approach                         | Lifecycle Approach                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus on delivery speed             | Focus on sustainable delivery performance            |
| Use of averages and assumptions     | Use of verified, route-specific data                 |
| Operational cost as sole metric     | Combined cost–impact–efficiency modeling             |
| Sustainability reported separately  | Sustainability integrated into daily logistics ops   |

By embedding lifecycle data into transport, packaging, and warehousing decisions, logistics teams gain a **powerful new lens** for smarter strategy.

## Conclusion

In logistics, efficiency gets things delivered.  
But only lifecycle metrics show whether those deliveries come at a sustainable cost.

With **Sustainly**, logistics professionals can shift from reactive reporting to proactive optimization — building smarter systems that reduce emissions, strengthen supplier relationships, and meet rising expectations from clients and regulators alike.

> 🚚 **Key takeaway:** Fast isn’t enough. Make logistics smart, measurable, and sustainable — every step of the way.
