Biotech and biopharma production blend complex biology with strict quality and regulatory obligations. This mix makes sustainability impacts both **substantial** (cleanrooms, utilities, cold chain) and **difficult to map** (batch variability, multi-step workflows, sensitive formulations). A structured sustainability analysis helps teams surface hidden hotspots, compare alternatives, and communicate credible insights across R&D, operations, procurement, and leadership.

**Where Sustainly fits**: Sustainly uses transparent AI to centralize sustainability data, guide teams through consistent modeling, and make complex workflows more accessible—whether you’re an environmental specialist or a bioprocess engineer. Automated unit alignment, AI-supported data mapping, and simple scenario building make it easier for teams to scale sustainability practices across products and sites.

## Where Impacts Typically Hide

- **Cleanroom HVAC**: high ACH rates and tight environmental control drive large electricity use.
- **Utilities**: purified water, clean steam, CIP/SIP cycles, compressed gases, cooling systems.
- **Single-use consumables**: bags, tubing, filters—lightweight materials but frequent turnover and end-of-life impacts.
- **Upstream media & feeds**: complex ingredient footprints and global supply chains.
- **Cold chain**: ultra-low storage and temperature-controlled transport.
- **Yield variability**: lower output or failed batches magnify per-unit impacts.

## Quick Start (One Product, One Site, Simple Afternoon Workflow)

1. **Define scope**: from raw materials to fill-finish; report results both **per batch** and **per functional unit** (e.g., 1,000 doses).
2. **Collect key data**:
   - Media/feeds: mass per batch, supplier region.
   - Utilities: electricity, purified water, steam, cooling demand, CIP/SIP cycles.
   - Single-use components: typical consumables and quantities.
   - Cleaning: chemicals and rinse volumes.
   - Cold chain: storage temperatures, energy use, transport.
3. **Choose impact areas**: include climate and additional categories (water use, resource use, pollution indicators) to capture trade-offs.
4. **Explore scenarios**: equipment choices, yield changes, HVAC strategies, heat recovery, batch size adjustments.
5. **Summarize insights**: identify hotspots and recommend improvements with clear assumptions and uncertainty notes.

**In Sustainly**: Import spreadsheets, let AI map components and utilities, and clone improvement scenarios rapidly—all stored in one shared workspace for your team.

## Comparing Single-Use and Stainless Options

- **Stainless workflows**: primarily driven by cleaning requirements—energy, water, chemicals, and downtime.
- **Single-use workflows**: driven by consumable materials, upstream manufacturing, and end-of-life treatment.
- **Fair comparison tips**: keep batch size, quality constraints, and turnaround time consistent. Consider packaging, transport, equipment life cycles, and changeover impacts.

**In Sustainly**: Build two structured scenarios and adjust variables like annual batch numbers, consumable quantities, or cleaning requirements to compare options side-by-side.

## Utilities & Cleanroom: The Big Levers

- **Water and steam**: track energy intensity of production systems and potential recovery opportunities.
- **CIP/SIP**: document cycle counts, temperatures, and chemical use.
- **HVAC**: adjust ACH assumptions, room grades, and operating hours.
- **Cooling systems**: include energy intensity and performance factors.

**Scenario ideas**:
- Heat recovery in utility loops  
- Reduced ACH within validated ranges  
- Optimized cleaning recipes  
- Smarter batch scheduling to reduce idle cleanroom hours  

## Cold Chain & Logistics

- **Storage**: capture energy per day and operational patterns.
- **Transport**: dry ice use, packaging weight, distance, and transport mode.
- **Alternatives**: consider higher temperature bands, consolidated shipments, or phase-change materials where allowed.

**In Sustainly**: Compare transport lanes, temperature settings, and packing options through quick scenario variations.

## Mini Case: mAb Pilot Line (Illustrative Only)

- **Setup**: 2,000 L upstream system; reporting per 1,000 doses.
- **Hotspots**: purified water/steam demand, HVAC in high-grade rooms, and upstream yield.
- **Explored scenarios**:
  1. **Single-use upstream** to reduce cleaning operations.
  2. **Yield improvement** (+15%) to spread utilities across more output.
  3. **Utility heat recovery + HVAC optimization**.
- **Directional outcomes**:
  - Single-use upstream reduced climate impact; waste increased but manageable with recovery routes.
  - Yield gains produced strong reductions across most categories.
  - Utility and HVAC tuning improved overall energy intensity.
- **Action path**: prioritize yield and HVAC adjustments; pilot single-use upstream; monitor quality and revisit full transitions later.

## Supplier & Data Templates (Copy-Ready Fields)

| Block      | Field                                                      | Unit/Note                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Media      | Component name, kg per batch                               | Include supplier region  |
| Utilities  | Purified water L/batch + energy per L; steam; electricity  | Metered or estimated     |
| CIP/SIP    | Cycles/batch, chemicals kg, water L                        | Include temperature/time |
| Single-use | Bag L → kg, filter m² → kg, tubing m → kg                  | Include sterilization    |
| HVAC       | Room grade, ACH, operating hours                           | kWh/day or per batch     |
| Cold chain | Storage energy/day, shipment dry ice, km by mode           | Lane detail              |

**In Sustainly**: Save data-mapping templates, auto-harmonize units, and keep everything stored for reuse across products.

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **Using only per-batch results** → add per-dose metrics to understand yield effects.
- **Skipping QA constraints** → keep scenario adjustments within validated ranges.
- **Overlooking sterilization/disposal** → especially relevant for single-use.
- **Ignoring cleanroom intensity** → HVAC often dominates in biotech.
- **Reporting only climate impact** → broaden categories to catch trade-offs.

## FAQ

**Is single-use always lower impact?**  
Not necessarily. Utilities saved may be offset by consumables or disposal impacts. Compare options with real site assumptions.

**Can I start with partial data?**  
Yes—screening-level assessments help identify priorities. Refine with supplier data and metered utilities as you go.

**How do I handle confidential media recipes?**  
Group sensitive components into broader categories and keep exact compositions off-model. Document the grouping approach.

**What about failed batches?**  
Model an estimated failure rate to understand sensitivity and support yield-improvement decisions.
