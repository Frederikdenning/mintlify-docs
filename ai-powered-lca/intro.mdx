## Why Sustainly Is Your Smarter Choice for Scalable, AI-Powered LCA?

- **Traditional life cycle assessment (LCA) tools are often slow, complex, and built for experts**â€”making them inaccessible to most product teams and sustainability managers. The steep learning curve and setup burden mean many organizations never adopt them.
- Yet todayâ€™s landscape demands better: **EU CSRD, product carbon regulations, and climate risk disclosures require fast, transparent, and scalable environmental metrics**.
- Sustainly was built to democratize credible LCA. **Our **[**AI-powered platform**](https://learn.sustainly.ai/4.Tutorials/3.simple-example)** makes environmental impact modeling accessible to non-expertsâ€”without compromising on rigor.** Whether you're generating EPDs, running comparative assessments, or reporting to corporate standards, Sustainly delivers speed, traceability, and confidence.

## Why Sustainly Outperforms Traditional LCA Software?

Sustainly redefines life cycle assessment (LCA) by combining AI automation, methodological rigor, and enterprise-grade scalabilityâ€”making credible LCA accessible to modern teams.

<Icon icon="head-side-gear" iconType="regular" size={19} /> **AI-Enabled Modeling at Scale**

- Automatically generate LCA models using your existing operational, material, and product dataâ€”scale across product lines and iterate in real time.
- Simplify every stepâ€”from selecting datasets to adding waste streams and updating metadataâ€”with intelligent guidance built into your workflow.

<Icon icon="ruler-combined" size={20} /> **Standards-Ready Workflows**

- Generate compliant [EPD](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/standards) tables, maintain full traceability, and ensure EN 15804 alignment for verified reporting.
- Support [EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/methods), and multiple allocation methods for credible, standards-aligned assessments.

<Icon icon="database" size={20} /> **Integrated & Transparent Data**

- Access the [EU Environmental Footprint database and integrate Ecoinvent](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/database) for high-resolution modeling and regional specificity.
- Maintain metadata, conduct audits, and centralize your data into a single source of truthâ€”ensuring trust and reproducibility at scale.

<Icon icon="building-user" size={20} /> **Enterprise-Grade Deployment**

- Enable multi-user access, connect via API, and integrate seamlessly with PLM and ERP systems for scalable deployment.

<Icon icon="school-circle-check" size={20} /> **Academic Access & Learning Support**

- Freely access LCA tutorials, datasets, and examples aligned with academic standards for classroom, research and [independent study](https://learn.sustainly.ai/4.Tutorials/3.simple-example).
