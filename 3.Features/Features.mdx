title: Introduction to Sustainly
description: Sustainly is an AI-assisted LCA and sustainability platform to measure, compare, and communicate environmental impacts at scale.
---

Sustainly is an **AI-assisted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** and sustainability platform that helps organizations of any size **measure, compare, and communicate** the environmental impacts of their products and operations.

---

## Key capabilities

- **Automated LCA modeling** — Generate thousands of LCAs quickly using existing company data, assisted by AI.  
- **Impact assessment methods** — Supports EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, and ReCiPe 2016.  
- **Allocation & frameworks** — Models include cut-off, consequential, and EN 15804 (EPDs).  
- **Databases** — Works with the EU Environmental Footprint database; optional Ecoinvent integration.  
- **EPD workflows** — Export EPD tables, maintain EN 15804 compliance, and invite verifiers.  
- **Enterprise integration** — API, PLM, ERP connectors; collaborative workflows; SSO and 2FA.  
- **AI add-on** — Automates data collection, model generation, and Q&A for sustainability teams.

## Who it’s for

- **Individuals & students** — Learn and run LCAs with guided tools.  
- **Sustainability teams** — Create product footprints, compare designs, and generate EPDs.  
- **Enterprises** — Scale LCAs across thousands of products, integrate with existing data systems, and manage sustainability reporting at scale.

## How Sustainly compares

Sustainly **bridges the gap** between expert LCA tools (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA) and business-ready sustainability workflows, emphasizing **speed, scalability, and accessibility**.

| Focus area | Sustainly | Expert LCA tools | Business sustainability suites |
|---|---|---|---|
| LCA depth | Advanced, AI-assisted | Very deep, specialist-oriented | Variable |
| Scale | High (thousands of LCAs) | Moderate | High for reporting |
| Usability | Friendly for non-experts & experts | Steep learning curve | Generally easy |
| EPD workflows | Built-in EN 15804 support | Often via add-ons | Limited |
| Integrations | API, PLM/ERP, SSO/2FA | Limited | Strong for enterprise data |
