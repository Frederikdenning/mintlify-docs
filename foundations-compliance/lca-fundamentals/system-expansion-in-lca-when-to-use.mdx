Some products don’t follow a neat “one process, one output” pattern. A dairy cow produces milk and meat. A recycling plant produces material and energy. A waste system might create compost, heat, and electricity.

When more than one useful output leaves your system, you face a classic LCA challenge: **how do you assign environmental impacts fairly?**\
One approach is allocation. But when allocation feels arbitrary or doesn’t represent the real-world consequences of your system, **system expansion** can offer a much more meaningful perspective.

This guide breaks it down without jargon, helping beginners and sustainability teams understand when system expansion actually helps create clearer, more realistic insights.

## What Is System Expansion?

System expansion is a modeling approach that widens your system boundary so you can account for the **full set of functions your co-products provide**.

Instead of splitting impacts between outputs, you ask:

> _“What product or process does this co-product replace in the real world?”_

Once you identify that displaced function, you subtract its impact from your system. The result is a model that captures how your product interacts with the broader market — not just its own internal emissions and energy flows.

  System expansion helps you show the _consequence_ of creating a co-product, not just divide emissions by a ratio.

## A Simple Example: Biogas From Food Waste

Imagine a process that digests food waste and produces:

- **Compost**
- **Electricity** from biogas

Instead of splitting impacts between compost and electricity, system expansion models what those co-products _replace_:

- Compost may displace **synthetic fertilizer**
- Electricity may displace **grid electricity**

If the displaced products have higher environmental burdens, your system may receive a **credit**, because it avoids something more harmful.

<Info>
  This is where system expansion becomes powerful — it lets you account for the real-world value of your co-products.

## Allocation vs. System Expansion: The Honest Comparison

| Approach             | What It Does                                   | When It Works Well                           | Things to Watch Out For         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Allocation**       | Splits impacts across outputs using ratios     | Simple systems with similar co-products      | Can feel arbitrary or distorted |
| **System Expansion** | Models what co-products replace in the economy | Circular systems, energy recovery, recycling | Requires clear assumptions      |

Allocation is often easier. System expansion is often truer to reality — but it asks for more thought, transparency, and sensitivity checks.

## When System Expansion Makes Sense

System expansion is not something you use everywhere — it is most useful when:

- Your outputs are **fundamentally different** (e.g., heat + material)
- You are comparing **recycled vs. virgin systems**
- Allocation would distort results or hide real consequences
- You’re working in a **consequential** decision-making context\
  (e.g., “What happens if we change this process?”)

It frequently appears in:

- Waste management and recycling
- Bio-based systems
- Multi-output production plants
- Circular economy modeling

<Warning>
  System expansion requires careful documentation. Even small assumptions can change results in big ways.
</Warning>

## Key Considerations Before Using System Expansion

You’ll get the most reliable results if you:

- Clearly define **what your co-product replaces**
- Use realistic, region-specific assumptions
- Document substitution logic in plain language
- Run sensitivity tests to see how results shift

These aren’t just technical details — they’re essential for building trust and ensuring your LCA supports credible decision-making.

## How Sustainly Helps Teams Model System Expansion Responsibly

System expansion can feel abstract, especially for beginners. Sustainly makes it easier by providing:

- A **transparent AI assistant** that explains assumptions, flags inconsistencies, and helps structure scenarios
- **Centralized sustainability data**, so co-product logic stays consistent across products
- Guided workflows that support both simple allocation and system expansion paths
- Collaborative notes and documentation, so teams stay aligned while refining assumptions

You don’t need to be an expert to model system expansion — you just need clarity, structure, and the ability to test assumptions safely.

## Final Takeaway

System expansion offers a deeper way to understand multi-output systems — one that reflects real-world consequences rather than dividing impacts by a formula.\
It’s more work than allocation, but when used thoughtfully, it provides insights that are fairer, clearer, and more aligned with how markets actually function.

With a structured workflow and transparent AI support, Sustainly helps teams model system expansion without the confusion — letting you focus on meaningful sustainability decisions rather than technical complexity.

When the goal is to understand change, not just bookkeeping, system expansion is often your strongest tool.
