If you’ve ever tried to pull together data for an LCA, you know one thing: the information you *want* and the information you *have* are rarely the same. Some data sits neatly in your internal systems. Other information comes from suppliers, emails, or specifications. And then there’s everything you simply can’t measure — the upstream mining, refining, or processing that happens long before materials reach you.

This is exactly why LCA distinguishes between **foreground** and **background** data. Once you understand the difference, the entire modeling process becomes much clearer — and far easier to communicate to colleagues or stakeholders.

## What Is Foreground Data?

Foreground data is everything that sits within your direct reach — the activities you can observe, measure, or meaningfully influence.  
It describes *how you* make your product, not how the world supplies its raw materials.

Think of foreground data as the “story you know firsthand.”

📍 **Typical examples:**

- The exact weight of your product or components  
- Energy use inside your facility or assembly line  
- Scrap rates or yield losses during production  
- Packaging choices and configurations  
- Transport distances from your warehouse to distributors  
- Supplier-specific details, when provided  

<Info>
Foreground data grounds your assessment in reality. It captures your unique design and operational decisions — the parts that make your product different from everyone else’s.

## What Is Background Data?

Background data fills in everything **outside** your direct control.  
It comes from industry-average databases that model processes like steel production, grid electricity, agriculture, chemical refining, and hundreds of other upstream activities.

Because no company can manually collect data from every supplier’s supplier (and their suppliers too), background databases provide these values with consistent, scientific structure.

📍 **Typical examples:**

- Average national electricity mixes  
- Global processes for stainless steel, polypropylene, or aluminum  
- Emissions from petrochemical refining  
- Generic recycling and waste treatment models  
- Regional transport averages  

Background data doesn’t represent *your* operations — it represents typical conditions in the wider economy.

## Why the Distinction Matters

Foreground and background data play different roles in your sustainability insights.

| Factor        | Foreground Data                    | Background Data                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy      | High — specific to your product    | Medium — based on industry averages       |
| Influence     | You can change these inputs        | You rarely influence these processes      |
| Transparency  | Usually easy to trace and explain  | Often complex or less transparent         |
| Use in EPDs   | Required for credibility           | Allowed with proper disclosure            |

Both types matter. The art of LCA is combining them thoughtfully so your results are both realistic and comparable.

## How to Gather Strong Foreground Data

Even experienced teams struggle with data collection. A few practical habits make a huge difference:

- Start with the basics: **materials**, **energy**, **transport**, **packaging**  
- Ask suppliers for simple tables instead of long surveys  
- Use consistent units (kg, kWh, km)  
- Record where each value came from — and when  
- Capture minimum/maximum ranges when exact values aren’t available  
- Don’t chase perfection; aim for clarity and consistency  

**In Sustainly**, transparent AI can flag missing units, detect unusual values, and highlight potential inconsistencies — helping teams collect and structure their data without guesswork.

Good data doesn’t have to be perfect — it just needs to be clear, traceable, and structured.

## How Much Background Data Is OK?

A common beginner question is “How much background data is too much?”  
The answer depends on what you’re trying to achieve:

- **Initial screening or comparison:**  
  Background-heavy models are fine. The goal is understanding directionally where impacts occur.

- **Customer communication or tender responses:**  
  More foreground data improves credibility.

- **EPDs or regulated disclosures:**  
  Foreground data is essential; background data is allowed but must be documented.

What matters most is transparency: make it clear what you measured yourself and what comes from databases.

<Warning>
Never mix foreground and background values without documenting the source — reviewers look for this immediately.
</Warning>

## How Sustainly Helps Teams Handle Both Data Types

Most challenges in sustainability stem from messy or inconsistent data. Sustainly supports beginners and experts by offering:

- A **centralized hub** where all sustainability data lives  
- Transparent AI that highlights missing or inconsistent entries  
- Clear tagging for sources, dates, and assumptions  
- Reusable templates so teams don’t start from scratch  
- Structured workflows that ensure foreground data stays front and center  

With everything in one place, your LCA becomes easier to scale, easier to review, and easier to explain.

## Final Takeaway

Foreground data shows how *your* product is made.  
Background data fills in everything the world does on your behalf.  

Both are essential. The key is knowing which is which — and documenting your decisions with clarity.

When your sustainability data is structured and supported by transparent AI, as it is in Sustainly, the entire process becomes smoother, more credible, and far more accessible to non-experts.

A strong LCA doesn’t start with perfect data — it starts with clear definitions.
