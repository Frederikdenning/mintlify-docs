## Introduction: Compliance Is the New Competitive Edge

Sustainability isn‚Äôt just about doing good anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs about proving it.  
From **EU‚Äôs Green Deal** to **EN 15804 standards** for Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), businesses across sectors are under mounting pressure to quantify and report their environmental impacts accurately.  

Yet, compliance with **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** standards is often slow, expensive, and complex. Sustainly changes that narrative with automation, data integrity, and accessible workflows.

## What Is LCA Compliance?

**LCA compliance** means aligning your environmental footprint assessments with recognized international standards and frameworks ‚Äî ensuring your results are credible, verifiable, and comparable.

| Standard / Framework | Description |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| **ISO 14040/14044** | Defines core LCA principles and methodology. |
| **EN 15804** | Governs construction product EPDs under EU standards. |
| **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)** | EU‚Äôs harmonized method for product LCAs. |
| **GHG Protocol & IPCC 2021** | Used for carbon reporting and climate impact analysis. |

> üí° **Tip:** Most EPD verifiers and regulators require LCAs to align with at least ISO 14040 and EN 15804. Automating these structures saves hours of manual validation.

## Why LCA Compliance Matters

Compliance isn‚Äôt just a checkbox ‚Äî it‚Äôs a *trust mechanism*.  
It ensures transparency, comparability, and credibility in sustainability claims.

**Three key reasons to prioritize compliance:**

1. **Regulatory Alignment:** Avoid penalties and qualify for green public procurement or eco-labels.  
2. **Market Advantage:** Compliant LCAs and EPDs open doors to green markets and preferred supplier lists.  
3. **Investor Confidence:** Verified sustainability data attracts funding under ESG frameworks.

## The Challenges of Staying Compliant

Even seasoned sustainability teams face these hurdles:

- **Fragmented Data Sources:** Multiple spreadsheets and systems that don‚Äôt sync.  
- **Manual Reporting:** Time-consuming verification and formatting.  
- **Complex Updates:** Regulations evolve faster than documentation workflows.  
- **Cost Barriers:** Expert software and consultancy fees add up quickly.

<Warning>Be careful: relying on manual compliance management can lead to reporting errors or outdated methods.</Warning>
