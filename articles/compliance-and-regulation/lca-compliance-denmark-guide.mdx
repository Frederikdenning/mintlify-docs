## Introduction  
In Denmark, sustainability is no longer optional—it’s embedded into the regulatory fabric. Under the Bygningsreglementet BR25 regulation, buildings of 1 000 m² or more must comply with life-cycle emission limits.  

For manufacturers, product developers and construction firms, this means that achieving LCA compliance is not just a nice-to-have—it’s increasingly a prerequisite for market access, permitting and competitive advantage.  

In this guide, you’ll learn **what** LCA compliance in Denmark involves, **why** it matters, and **how** to build an effective compliance workflow—anchored in how a tool like Sustainly can help you meet the requirements with speed, accuracy and scalability.

## What does LCA compliance in Denmark entail?  
LCA compliance in Denmark covers the set of regulatory, standard-based and documentation requirements that relate to life-cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental product declarations (EPDs) under Danish and European frameworks.

### Key standards & reference frameworks  
- The standard **EN 15804:2012+A2:2019** is the cornerstone for construction-product EPDs in Denmark.  
- The Danish programme operator **EPD Danmark** publishes technical rules that require compliance with EN 15804 for EPDs.  
- Under **BR25**, LCA and life-cycle carbon calculations are mandatory for most new buildings, with binding CO₂ thresholds for large projects.  

### Scope & coverage  
- **Products:** Manufacturers must publish Type III EPDs compliant with EN 15804 and complementary PCRs.  
- **Buildings:** New buildings (especially over 1 000 m²) must demonstrate life-cycle carbon calculations using modules defined in EN 15978 and EN 15804 frameworks.  
- Documentation must be transparent, verified and follow standardised templates approved by EPD Danmark.  

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Non-compliance can delay permits (in construction) or reduce market access (in manufacturing).

## Why is compliance important for your business?  

### 1. Regulatory risk and permitting  
Failing to provide required LCA documentation can lead to delays with planning authorities or denial of permits for new building projects.  

### 2. Market access & procurement  
Suppliers increasingly face procurement requirements to present verified EPDs. Having compliant and transparent LCA documentation is becoming a competitive advantage in both private and public tenders.  

### 3. Strategic sustainability advantage  
Doing compliant LCAs early enables your business to identify carbon hotspots, reduce your footprint, and prepare for future, stricter CO₂ thresholds. Using a platform like Sustainly lets you automate and scale compliance while gaining real-time sustainability insights.

## How to build an LCA compliance workflow  

Here’s a practical five-step workflow your sustainability or product team can follow:

### Step 1: Establish scope & regulatory mapping  
- Identify whether you’re working with a **product** or **building project**.  
- Map applicable frameworks: BR25 for buildings, EPD Danmark for products.  
- Define required life-cycle modules (A1–A3, A4–A5, B, C, D).  
- Check for any specific CO₂ limit values that apply to your project.  

### Step 2: Collect and organise your data  
- For products: collect data on materials, energy, logistics, and end-of-life scenarios.  
- For buildings: gather data on materials, quantities, transport, site operations, and component lifespans.  
- Use high-quality, standardised datasets (e.g., EF 3.1) and document all assumptions.  

### Step 3: Model the LCA or EPD  
- For products: create an EN 15804-compliant LCA and generate an EPD verified under EPD Danmark.  
- For buildings: use a compliant LCA tool (such as LCAbyg) and ensure that modules, scopes and data quality align with regulatory demands.  
- Clearly document allocation rules, functional units, and system boundaries.  

### Step 4: Verification and publication  
- Submit your LCA or EPD for third-party verification.  
- For EPDs, ensure compliance with EPD Danmark’s programme rules and publish results transparently.  
- Keep detailed records of verifiers, tool reports and datasets used.  

### Step 5: Monitor, update and integrate  
- Update regularly as standards evolve (e.g., new EN 15804 versions or CO₂ limits).  
- Integrate compliance workflows into design or product development.  
- Use automation and data integration features in Sustainly to keep models up-to-date effortlessly.

## Common pitfalls & how to avoid them  

| Mistake | Impact | How to avoid |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Ignoring life-cycle modules | LCA may not meet full regulatory scope | Verify required modules before modelling |
| Using generic data without justification | Data quality may be questioned | Always document sources and data quality |
| Skipping verification or publication | EPDs may be invalid | Follow EPD Danmark’s verification and publication steps |
| Treating compliance as one-off | Risk of outdated data and missed updates | Implement continuous monitoring |
| Viewing LCA only as a compliance task | Missed opportunity for optimization | Use LCA insights to improve design and reduce cost |

## FAQ  

**Q: Is LCA mandatory for all buildings in Denmark?**  
A: Nearly all new buildings must calculate life-cycle emissions; larger ones must meet specific CO₂ thresholds.  

**Q: What version of EN 15804 should I use?**  
A: Use EN 15804+A2 with EF 3.1 impact methods for current EPDs under EPD Danmark.  

**Q: Can I use a non-Danish LCA tool?**  
A: Yes, but it must produce outputs compatible with Danish verification and programme requirements.  

**Q: How often should EPDs be updated?**  
A: Typically every five years, or sooner if product or standard changes occur.
