The EU Environmental Footprint (**EF 3.1**) is a multi-category impact assessment method widely requested by EU buyers, educators, and regulators. This guide provides an auditor-friendly workflow to align your LCA with EF 3.1—from scope and data quality to modeling rules and reporting. We also note where **Sustainly** keeps EF defaults consistent via templates and automation.

> Tip: You can report **IPCC 2021** climate results in parallel, but your primary table should follow **EF 3.1** categories.

## Who Typically Needs EF 3.1

- Suppliers responding to EU customer footprint requests
- Brands building comparable product dashboards for the EU market
- Universities teaching multi-category LCIA beyond carbon-only
- Enterprises preparing policy-ready evidence or pre-EPD analyses

## EF 3.1 Compliance — Quick Checklist

**Scope & Goal**

- Goal statement names **EF 3.1** as the primary method
- Functional/declared unit and decision context (comparative or not) are explicit
- Boundary chosen (cradle-to-gate / cradle-to-grave) with any exclusions justified

**Data Quality & Sources**

- **Primary (foreground)** data listed with site, year, technology, representativeness
- **Secondary (background)** from EF-compatible databases; version noted
- Data Quality Indicators (temporal, geographical, technological) recorded for key flows
- Electricity mixes and markets match geography and year

**Modeling Rules**

- Allocation approach (cut-off, consequential, etc.) is stated and applied consistently
- Recycling modeled transparently (collection, sorting, reprocessing)
- Transport modes, distances, and load factors documented
- End-of-life routes and rates explicit; credits/loads beyond boundary treated correctly

**Impact Assessment**

- **All required EF 3.1 categories** computed for your audience
- Any non-EF (e.g., IPCC 2021) labeled supplemental, not mixed into EF tables
- Characterization factors correspond to the EF 3.1 version in use

**Results & Reporting**

- Results reported **per functional/declared unit**
- Contribution analysis identifies top stages/flows
- Assumptions, cut-offs, and data gaps disclosed
- Sensitivities/scenarios (e.g., recycled content, energy mix) summarized

**Review & Governance**

- Internal QA: units, ranges, coverage checks passed
- Versioning captured (database versions, method IDs, data vintages)
- External review/verification plan defined if publishing outward

**In Sustainly:** Project templates lock **EF 3.1**, boundary, allocation, and geography defaults; notes and sources travel with exports.

## Step 1. Define Goal, Scope, and Unit

Name EF 3.1 as primary. Fix the **functional/declared unit**, boundary, geography, and study year. Avoid mid-study changes.

**Sustainly:** Setup wizard locks EF 3.1, allocation, boundary, geography, and year. Save as a template.

## Step 2. Gather Foreground Data (Primary)

Collect metered energy, materials, yields/scrap, packaging, and transport for controlled/supplier steps. Record **site, year, tech, source** per line.

**Minimum schema (per unit):** material kg, electricity kWh, fuels (MJ or kWh), transport km×mode, packaging g, waste routes, reporting year, site.

**Sustainly:** CSV importer + AI mapping; automatic unit harmonization (g→kg, miles→km, BTU→MJ).

## Step 3. Map Background Data (Secondary)

Use EF-compatible datasets for materials, energy, and waste. Match **region** and **technology**; document proxies and vintages.

**Sustainly:** Region/tech filters and suggestions; flags off-region picks.

## Step 4. Set Allocation & Recycling Rules

State allocation (e.g., **cut-off**). For recycled content and end-of-life, document collection, sorting, reprocessing, and any credits/loads beyond boundary.

**Sustainly:** Project-level settings cascade; notes panel captures rules for reviewers.

## Step 5. Compute EF 3.1 Categories (Plus Optional IPCC)

Run EF 3.1 for the multi-category view (climate, resource use, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical ozone formation, water use, etc.). Optionally add **IPCC 2021** climate as supplemental.

**Sustainly:** One-click method switch; EF 3.1 and IPCC 2021 side by side without rebuild.

## Step 6. Contribution & Sensitivity Analyses

Identify top hotspots and test levers (recycled content, transport mode, energy mix, lifetime). Keep unit and boundary identical.

**Sustainly:** Clone scenarios; export comparison + hotspot charts.

## Step 7. Report Results, Assumptions, and Data Quality

Publish an EF-aligned table per unit, hotspot narrative, and **Data Quality** note (primary vs secondary, vintages, representativeness). Disclose cut-offs, proxies, and limitations.

**Template note (copy-ready):**\
Primary: 2024 metered electricity and process data at Brno site. Secondary: EU Environmental Footprint DB (vX); ecoinvent added for [flows]. Geography: EU; transport per logistics plan. Allocation: cut-off. Minor items `&lt;1%` mass/energy excluded and listed.

**Sustainly:** Exports include notes and versions automatically.

## Common Pitfalls & Fast Fixes

- **Mixing methods in one table** → keep EF 3.1 tables pure; put IPCC 2021 elsewhere.
- **Wrong region datasets** → match geography/tech; document proxies.
- **Only climate reported** → EF is multi-category; include required categories.
- **Unit inconsistencies** → normalize to SI; run range checks.
- **Missing end-of-life** → specify routes/rates; avoid ad-hoc credits.

## Mini Example: Packaging Change Under EF 3.1

Brand compares virgin PET vs rPET bottle bodies (EU). EF 3.1 shows climate/resource gains for rPET with a small trade-off elsewhere. Decision: move to rPET, rail where feasible, disclose trade-off note.

## FAQ

**Can I submit only EF climate?** No—report the full EF set; show IPCC climate separately if needed.\
**What database do I need?** Start with **EU Environmental Footprint**; add **ecoinvent** for gaps and document mix.\
**Do I need external verification?** For public claims/EPD-adjacent comms, plan an external review.\
**How often to refresh?** Annually or after material/energy/supplier changes.

## Why Use Sustainly For EF 3.1

- EF 3.1 templates out-of-the-box
- AI mapping + unit harmonization
- Quick scenario cloning
- Parallel IPCC 2021 without rebuild
- Notes/sources/versioning preserved in exports; SSO/2FA collaboration
