The construction sector depends heavily on **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** for sustainability reporting and compliance ‚Äî yet most companies face the same bottleneck: **incomplete or inconsistent data**.  

As digital requirements under **EN 15804**, **Level(s)**, and **CSRD** increase, data quality has become the difference between compliance and costly project delays.  
The challenge isn‚Äôt intent ‚Äî it‚Äôs **data complexity**. Thousands of materials, suppliers, and tools make traditional LCA work painfully slow and prone to error.

## Why Construction Faces the Toughest LCA Data Problems

| Root Cause | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Fragmented data sources** | Material data spread across ERP, BIM, and spreadsheets |
| **Supplier inconsistency** | Incomplete environmental declarations from upstream partners |
| **Manual workflows** | Long approval chains and versioning errors between consultants and verifiers |
| **Incompatible formats** | Different datasets using varying units and impact methods |

<Callout icon="alert-octagon" color="#f59e0b">
Even a small data inconsistency can lead to EPD rejection under EN 15804 ‚Äî wasting months of work.

## How Data Gaps Impact the Industry

- ‚ùå **Verification delays:** Missing inputs stall EPD approvals and public declarations  
- üí∏ **Increased cost:** Repeated consultant corrections inflate budgets  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Compliance risk:** Weak data governance can breach CSRD or PEF standards  
- üìâ **Reputation loss:** Poorly documented impacts damage credibility with clients and regulators

## The Shift: From Manual Models to Automated LCAs

<Callout icon="rocket" color="#22C55E">
Automation turns LCAs from reactive documentation into proactive intelligence.
</Callout>

### 1. Centralized Data Collection  
Sustainly connects **ERP, BIM, and supplier databases** to build unified datasets.  
Teams can access verified impact data without searching through dozens of spreadsheets.

### 2. Smart Data Validation  
AI-assisted checks identify missing or conflicting values before submission, ensuring EPDs are **verifier-ready**.

### 3. EN 15804-Compliant EPD Templates  
Prebuilt workflows guide teams through each required step, aligning automatically with European standards.

### 4. Real-Time Collaboration  
Verifiers can access and comment directly in the Sustainly workspace ‚Äî no endless file versions or email chains.

| Sustainly Advantage | Impact |
|----------------------|--------|
| **Automatic quality checks** | Reduces verifier rejection rates |
| **Linked data sources** | Ensures consistent values across all projects |
| **Cloud-based collaboration** | Cuts EPD delivery times by up to 80% |

## Real-World Example: Danish Building Materials Manufacturer

A mid-sized **Danish construction supplier** faced months of delay publishing 30+ EPDs due to fragmented LCA spreadsheets.  
By integrating **Sustainly** with its ERP and production data, the company:

- Cut manual data entry by **85%**  
- Generated **verifier-ready EPDs** for all products  
- Standardized LCA methods across multiple factories  
- Improved transparency for public procurement bids  

> üí° The result: faster EPD approvals, consistent compliance, and better positioning for EU Green Public Procurement tenders.

## Practical Steps for Closing Data Gaps

<Tip>Use these actions as a foundation for digital LCA readiness in construction.</Tip>

1. **Map data flows** ‚Äî Identify every system (ERP, BIM, supplier) holding environmental data.  
2. **Unify your tools** ‚Äî Move to an LCA platform that integrates with existing digital infrastructure.  
3. **Standardize inputs** ‚Äî Require suppliers to use verified databases like EF 3.1 or ecoinvent.  
4. **Automate reports** ‚Äî Generate EPDs through AI-supported templates for faster compliance.  
5. **Audit periodically** ‚Äî Keep datasets updated before new EPD submissions.

## FAQs

**Why is the construction industry so dependent on LCAs?**  
Because regulations like EN 15804 and Level(s) make LCAs mandatory for material transparency and EPD publication.

**Can automation really replace consultant work?**  
Not replace ‚Äî enhance. Automation handles data collection and checks so experts can focus on interpretation and improvement.

**Does Sustainly support verifier collaboration?**  
Yes. Sustainly includes built-in verifier access, ensuring smooth reviews and faster EPD validation cycles.
