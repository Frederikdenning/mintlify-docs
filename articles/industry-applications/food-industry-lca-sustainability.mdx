> 🥦 Food production is responsible for around **one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions** (FAO, 2023).Yet most food companies still lack detailed visibility into where those emissions come from. **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** offers that visibility — but it remains underused across the industry.

## What LCAs Reveal in the Food Sector

A **Life Cycle Assessment** quantifies a product’s environmental footprint from farm to fork — including agriculture, processing, packaging, transport, and waste.\
It captures much more than carbon: water use, eutrophication, land occupation, and resource depletion are all part of the picture.

| Stage           | Typical Impacts                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌾 Agriculture  | Fertilizers, irrigation, land use, methane from livestock |
| 🏭 Processing   | Energy consumption, packaging materials, refrigerants     |
| 🚚 Distribution | Cold-chain logistics and transport emissions              |
| 🍽️ Consumption | Cooking, food waste, and end-of-life packaging            |
| ♻️ Disposal     | Composting, recycling, or landfill effects                |

<Info>
  LCAs identify where environmental pressure is greatest — often at the agricultural or processing stage — enabling targeted reductions rather than generic pledges.

## Why Food Companies Still Lag Behind

While large corporations publish footprint averages, smaller producers and brands rarely perform full LCAs. Barriers include fragmented supply chains, limited expertise, and the cost of traditional LCA software.

| Barrier                      | Impact                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌍 **Complex Supply Chains** | Multiple ingredient origins make data collection difficult.         |
| 💸 **High Costs**            | Specialist software and consultants remain expensive.               |
| 🕐 **Time-Intensive**        | Manual calculations slow down decision-making.                      |
| ⚖️ **Low Awareness**         | Many companies mistake generic footprint calculators for full LCAs. |

> As EU sustainability reporting and labeling rules tighten, these excuses are becoming obsolete.

## The Policy Push: Why LCAs Are Becoming Essential

The European Union is preparing to roll out several frameworks that rely directly on **LCA-based metrics**:

- **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)**: standardized LCA method for all EU products.
- **Green Claims Directive**: requires scientific proof for environmental marketing claims.
- **Sustainable Food System Framework** (expected 2025): will extend PEF into food labeling.

> Food companies that integrate LCAs now will be ready for compliance — and ahead of competitors relying on averages.

## How Startups and SMEs Can Lead

Emerging food brands and agri-tech startups can move faster than large corporations by integrating LCAs early.

| Advantage                   | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌱 **Transparency**         | Demonstrate verified impact to conscious consumers and buyers. |
| 📈 **Scalability**          | Automate LCAs for multiple recipes or SKUs.                    |
| 💶 **Market Access**        | Meet procurement and export requirements faster.               |
| ⚙️ **Data-driven Sourcing** | Compare supplier footprints and optimize procurement.          |

<Tip>
  With **Sustainly**, even small producers can generate full LCAs using supplier and ingredient data — without external consultants.

## Using LCAs to Improve Food Products

### 1. **Ingredient Comparison**

Quantify the footprint difference between conventional and regenerative wheat, or dairy vs. plant-based alternatives. LCAs reveal which swaps deliver the largest emissions and water savings.

### 2. **Packaging Decisions**

Compare materials such as glass, aluminum, bioplastics, or cardboard using consistent impact categories.\
This avoids “false positives” — for instance, lighter plastics may outperform glass on total CO₂ per use.

### 3. **Logistics Optimization**

Assess the trade-off between local sourcing and centralized distribution.\
In many cases, efficient transport systems can offset longer distances if production impacts are lower.

### 4. **Reporting and Labeling**

Generate compliant, verifiable data for ESG reports, tenders, or future EU food labels — all grounded in standardized LCA methods.

## Practical Steps for Food Companies

1. **Define system boundaries** — “farm to gate” or “farm to fork” depending on your goal.
2. **Collect key data** — yields, fertilizers, packaging materials, and energy use.
3. **Use standardized impact methods** — EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016 ensure comparability.
4. **Automate with Sustainly** — upload ingredient and supplier data to run scalable LCAs.
5. **Communicate results responsibly** — share verified numbers, not unverified claims.

<Info>
  LCAs transform sustainability from storytelling into measurable performance — essential for long-term credibility.
