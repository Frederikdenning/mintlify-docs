Biotech manufacturing blends biology and strict compliance, which makes environmental impacts both **significant** (utilities, cleanrooms, cold chain) and **hard to quantify** (batch variability, multi-product sites, confidential recipes). **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** structures these complexities so teams can compare options (e.g., single-use vs. stainless), target utilities with the biggest effect, and communicate credibly with customers and regulators.

**Why Sustainly here?** AI-assisted mapping for media/components, automated unit harmonization, scenario cloning (batch size, titer/yield, cleaning cycles), EF 3.1/IPCC methods, and EN 15804-style exports when needed. Students get **free access**.

## Where Impacts Typically Hide

- **Cleanroom HVAC**: high air changes per hour (ACH) and tight temp/RH control → big electricity draw.
- **Utilities**: **WFI** (water for injection), clean steam, CIP/SIP cycles, compressed gases (N₂, air), process cooling.
- **Single-use consumables**: bags, tubing, filters, connectors—small mass, but frequent replacement and incineration.
- **Upstream media & feeds**: complex supply chains for amino acids, vitamins, antifoams.
- **Cold chain**: −20 °C to −80 °C storage, dry ice shipments, ultra-low freezers.
- **Yield variability**: low titer or failed batches amplify per-dose impacts.

## Quick Start (One Product, One Site, One Afternoon)

1. **Scope**: cradle-to-gate (upstream → fill-finish), declared unit = **per batch** and **per 1,000 doses**.
2. **Inventory**:
   - Media/feeds: kg per batch (or per L broth), supplier region.
   - Utilities: kWh electricity, steam/WFI (kWh or MJ equivalent), CIP/SIP cycles per batch.
   - Single-use: bag volumes, filter areas, tubing lengths (convert to kg).
   - Cleaning: caustic/acid kg per cycle, rinse volumes.
   - Cold chain: storage setpoints, kWh/day, transport legs.
3. **Methods**: IPCC 2021 (climate) + EF 3.1 (multi-category).
4. **Scenarios**: single-use vs. stainless; yield +/−20%; HVAC setpoint optimization; WFI heat recovery.
5. **Deliverables**: hotspot chart + one-page recommendation with uncertainty notes.

**In Sustainly**: Import BOM/utility sheets → AI maps names/units, suggests background datasets (EU PEF + optional ecoinvent), clone scenarios in minutes.

## Modeling Single-Use vs. Stainless (Fair Comparison)

- **Stainless baseline**: fabrication footprints (once, amortized by lifetime & batches), **CIP/SIP utilities** each batch, detergents, water, downtime.
- **Single-use baseline**: consumables mass per batch (films, caps, connectors), gamma sterilization (if applicable), **disposal** (incineration with/without energy recovery).
- **Make comparable**: same batch size, titer, quality criteria, and turnaround time assumptions. Include changeover losses for stainless; include packaging & transport for single-use.

**In Sustainly**: Create two scenarios from a template; parameterize **batches per year**, **lifetime cycles**, and **consumables per batch**.

## Utilities & Cleanroom: The Big Levers

- **WFI & clean steam**: track kWh (or MJ) per liter produced, system efficiency, and heat recovery.
- **CIP/SIP**: cycle counts, durations, temperatures—convert to energy and chemicals.
- **HVAC**: model ACH and setpoints by room grade (ISO 5/7/8); add hours at state.
- **Cooling**: chiller COP, kWh per hour of operation.

**Tuning scenarios**:

- Heat recovery on WFI/steam loops;
- Reduce ACH where permitted by QA;
- Optimize CIP recipes (low-temp alkali + longer soak vs. high-temp);
- Batch scheduling to reduce idle HVAC hours.

## Cold Chain & Logistics

- **Storage**: ultra-low freezers kWh/day × days; door-open frequency factor.
- **Distribution**: dry ice mass per leg, packaging weight, lane distance/mode.
- **Alternatives**: phase-change materials; consolidate shipments; ship at higher temp bands if stability allows.

**In Sustainly**: Transport datasets by mode/temperature; clone “lane” scenarios (air vs. road; −80 °C vs. −20 °C).

## Mini Case: mAb Pilot Line (Illustrative)

- **Setup**: 2,000 L upstream, stainless baseline; declared unit: per 1,000 doses.
- **Hotspots**: WFI/steam (A3-like utilities), HVAC for grade B rooms, low upstream yield.
- **Scenarios**:
  1. **Single-use upstream** (bags/filters, incineration) + reduced CIP/SIP.
  2. **Yield +15%** (process optimization).
  3. **WFI heat recovery + HVAC setpoint optimization (−1 °C)**.
- **Result (directional)**:
  - (1) Single-use vs. stainless: climate ↓ 10–18% per 1,000 doses; waste ↑ (manage via energy recovery).
  - (2) Yield +15%: climate ↓ 12–20% (utilities spread over more output).
  - (3) Heat recovery + HVAC tune: climate ↓ 6–10%; electricity intensity ↓.
- **Decision**: combine (2) + (3) now; pilot single-use in upstream only; revisit full single-use after 6 months of QA data.

## Supplier & Data Templates (Copy-Ready Fields)

| Block      | Field                                                      | Unit/Note                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Media      | Component name, kg per batch                               | Include supplier region  |
| Utilities  | WFI L/batch + kWh/L; steam MJ/batch; electricity kWh/batch | Metered or estimated     |
| CIP/SIP    | Cycles/batch, detergents kg, water L                       | Include temperature/time |
| Single-use | Bag L → kg, filter m² → kg, tubing m → kg                  | Include sterilization    |
| HVAC       | Room grade, ACH, hours at state                            | kWh/day or per batch     |
| Cold chain | Storage kWh/day, shipment kg dry ice, km by mode           | Lane detail              |

**In Sustainly**: Save importer mapping; unit harmonization auto-converts (L→m³, g→kg, BTU→MJ).

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **Comparing per batch vs. per dose** → always report both; dose-basis shows the real effect of yield.
- **Ignoring QA constraints** → reflect validated ranges in scenarios; note what is “non-GMP feasible”.
- **Omitting sterilization/disposal** for single-use → include gamma/EO and incineration.
- **No ACH accounting** → HVAC dominates cleanrooms; include grade/time.
- **Only climate reported** → add EF 3.1 categories (water, resource use, toxicity) to catch trade-offs.

## FAQ

**Is single-use always lower impact?**\
Not always. Utilities saved can be outweighed by consumables + disposal in some contexts. Compare with local energy mix and real CIP/SIP loads.

**Can I do this with partial data?**\
Yes—start screening-level with EU PEF datasets, then replace with metered utilities and supplier specs.

**How do I handle confidential media recipes?**\
Group components into anonymized categories (e.g., “amino acid blend”) and keep exact ratios off-model; document the approach.

**What about failed batches?**\
Model a failure rate scenario (e.g., +5% rework) to see per-dose sensitivity and justify yield investments.
