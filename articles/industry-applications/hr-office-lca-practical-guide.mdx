> 💬 “Every HR decision — from where people work to how they get paid — shapes a company’s footprint.”

In construction and building companies, HR rarely sees itself as a driver of environmental performance. Yet decisions around **offices, suppliers, services, payroll systems, and travel policies** directly influence the organisation’s carbon and resource footprint.  

By adopting **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** thinking, HR can turn everyday operational choices into measurable sustainability actions — proving that sustainability isn’t just about building sites, but also about the people and infrastructure that keep them running.

---

## Rethinking HR’s footprint: it’s bigger than you think
Even without touching raw materials or site equipment, HR manages significant indirect impacts:

| HR Activity | Example of Environmental Impact | Opportunity for Improvement |
|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Office fit-out | Materials, furniture, lighting, HVAC | Use low-impact, EPD-verified furniture and designs |
| Payroll & HR tech | Server energy, data storage, hardware | Choose cloud providers with renewable energy and end-of-life recycling |
| Workplace services | Cleaning, catering, employee perks | Contract vendors with life-cycle data and reduction commitments |
| Employee travel | Commuting, business trips | Introduce incentives for low-carbon transport and remote work setups |

> 💡 **Tip:** When HR maps out its “hidden” operations, it often discovers up to 15–25 % of a company’s operational emissions come from office and administrative activities.

## What LCA brings to the table for HR
LCA helps HR understand the *total impact* of decisions — from design to disposal — across every vendor and service.  
By quantifying environmental impacts, HR gains:

- **Data-backed decisions:** Move from guesswork to measurable sustainability.  
- **Supplier accountability:** Require life-cycle data in every HR-related contract.  
- **Transparent storytelling:** Use facts to communicate sustainability achievements to employees and candidates.  
- **Employee engagement:** Show how small operational changes have large, verified results.

  Sustainability becomes real when employees see it — and HR is the department best placed to make it visible.

## Where HR can apply LCA in daily operations

### 1. Office design and refurbishment  
Office renovations are perfect for LCA-driven decision-making.  
- Compare materials and layouts using embodied carbon data.  
- Choose furniture with verified Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs).  
- Opt for modular and reusable designs to extend product life.  
- Set a measurable KPI: *“Reduce embodied carbon per m² of office space by 20%.”*  

> 💡 **Practical move:** Use Sustainly’s AI-assisted LCA to assess the footprint of new office designs or supplier proposals before signing contracts.

---

### 2. Payroll, HRIS and digital operations  
Cloud software and payroll platforms consume energy and resources. HR can:  
- Request data centre energy sources and hardware recycling policies.  
- Compare payroll and HRIS vendors by their life-cycle impact per user.  
- Include sustainability as a criterion in RFPs and renewals.  
- Monitor annual footprint reductions in digital operations.  

<Warning>Even “paperless” systems have an environmental cost. Ask vendors for their infrastructure LCA summary before renewal.</Warning>

---

### 3. Workplace services (cleaning, catering, waste, travel)  
Every outsourced service comes with hidden emissions.  
- Require suppliers to provide life-cycle metrics in bids and tenders.  
- Evaluate cleaning and catering services by product lifecycle, packaging, and transport emissions.  
- Implement low-impact commuting policies — carpooling, electric mobility, or remote options.  
- Measure supplier compliance annually using Sustainly’s integrated dashboards.

---

### 4. Employee equipment & IT lifecycle  
Procurement of laptops, monitors, and headsets is usually managed by HR or IT but affects everyone’s footprint.  
- Choose vendors offering refurbished or recyclable equipment.  
- Use LCA data to compare models before purchase.  
- Offer take-back or reuse programs for old devices.  

> 💡 **Tip:** Sustainable procurement doubles as an engagement campaign — communicate reuse stats in internal newsletters or dashboards.

---

## How to get started: a 4-phase roadmap for HR
| Phase | Goal | Key Action |
|--------|------|------------|
| **1. Awareness** | Map all HR-managed assets and services. | Identify where lifecycle data exists or is missing. |
| **2. Assessment** | Measure baseline impacts. | Use Sustainly or supplier LCAs to calculate office and HR operations footprint. |
| **3. Action** | Set KPIs and integrate into procurement. | Add sustainability clauses and life-cycle metrics to contracts. |
| **4. Engagement** | Communicate and improve. | Share results with staff, highlight wins, and train teams. |

<Tip>Start small: pick one area (e.g., office furniture or HRIS vendor) and pilot LCA-based decision-making. Expand gradually.</Tip>

---

## Common mistakes to avoid
| Mistake | Why it matters | Fix |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Treating office sustainability as “facility work” | Misses major HR-driven impacts | Include HR in supplier and design decisions early. |
| Ignoring digital emissions | Data storage has high hidden energy costs | Request lifecycle data from payroll and HRIS vendors. |
| One-off projects | Impact fades fast | Set recurring KPIs tied to procurement and culture. |
| Overcomplicated reporting | Creates friction | Use automated dashboards for simple communication. |

---

## Example metrics HR can adopt
- **Embodied carbon (kg CO₂e/m²)** in new office designs  
- **% of suppliers providing life-cycle data**  
- **Reduction in HR tech operational footprint per employee**  
- **% of employee equipment reused or recycled**  
- **CO₂e savings from commuting policy improvements**

> 💬 “What gets measured gets managed — and when HR manages it, the whole organisation follows.”

## FAQ — Everyday HR and LCA
**Q: Can HR really influence technical LCA decisions?**  
Absolutely. HR controls the contracts, budgets, and culture that determine whether sustainability happens in daily operations.  

**Q: What’s a realistic first step?**  
Audit your office suppliers and service contracts — find out who already provides EPDs or LCA data.  

**Q: How does this help with recruitment?**  
Showcasing tangible, LCA-backed sustainability actions strengthens employer credibility and attracts talent.  

**Q: Why choose Sustainly?**  
Because Sustainly automates LCA work and visualises results across all company functions — letting HR lead with evidence, not intention.
