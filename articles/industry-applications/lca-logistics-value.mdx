  Every shipment has a story — LCAs help you read between the routes.

Logistics is one of the most visible yet least understood parts of a company’s environmental footprint. Transport networks are complex, multi-modal, and often outsourced — making it difficult to pinpoint where emissions, waste, and inefficiencies occur.

**Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** provides a structured, quantitative way to measure the true footprint of logistics operations — not just per kilometer or shipment, but across the entire movement of goods, energy, and materials.\
For logistics teams, it’s the difference between optimizing routes for speed and optimizing them for _sustainable performance_.

## 1. The challenge: movement without visibility

Logistics teams operate under constant trade-offs: speed vs. cost, flexibility vs. control.\
Environmental impact usually enters the discussion only after those decisions are made — if at all.\
Common problems include:

- Fragmented data from multiple carriers or third-party providers.
- Lack of transparency on fuel type, packaging waste, and warehouse energy use.
- Reporting limited to averages instead of shipment-specific performance.

The result? A logistics system that can move goods efficiently, but can’t show what it costs the planet to do so.

> LCA brings visibility to what has long been treated as invisible — the true lifecycle cost of movement.

## 2. What LCAs measure that carbon calculators miss

Basic carbon calculators only look at direct transport emissions. LCAs expand this scope.\
They consider the **entire lifecycle of logistics activities**, including:

- Vehicle and fuel production
- Infrastructure (warehouses, terminals)
- Maintenance and end-of-life disposal
- Packaging materials and return flows
- Combined multi-leg shipments (road, rail, sea, air)

| Metric                        | Carbon Calculator | LCA |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --- |
| Tailpipe emissions            | ✅                 | ✅   |
| Vehicle manufacturing         | ❌                 | ✅   |
| Energy mix and fuel source    | ⚠️                | ✅   |
| Packaging and waste           | ❌                 | ✅   |
| End-of-life and reuse systems | ❌                 | ✅   |

This holistic view reveals where small operational changes can have large cumulative effects — for instance, shifting from air to rail freight or optimizing backhauls for material reuse.

## 3. The new insight: logistics as a lifecycle system

When logistics teams apply LCA thinking, they stop viewing transport as a chain of deliveries and start seeing it as a **connected lifecycle**.\
This opens up new types of insights:

  <Card title="Route-level impact mapping" icon="map">
    Understand the carbon and resource intensity of specific routes or transport modes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Material loop visibility" icon="recycle">
    Track packaging, pallets, and containers across use and reuse cycles.

  <Card title="Energy efficiency benchmarking" icon="battery">
    Compare energy per ton-kilometer across modes and suppliers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scenario planning" icon="line-chart">
    Model how route or fuel changes affect emissions and costs.
  </Card>
</Columns>

These insights help logistics teams make data-backed decisions — not just to reduce emissions, but to **optimize cost, time, and sustainability simultaneously.**

## 4. Practical applications in logistics operations

### Smarter mode selection

LCAs make it possible to calculate impact per ton-kilometer across modes.\
Teams can see the verified difference between using long-haul rail instead of truck, or marine biofuel instead of conventional bunker fuel.

### Packaging and return logistics

By quantifying packaging’s lifecycle impact, LCAs can support shifts to reusable or modular systems — reducing waste while improving cost control.

### Supplier and carrier evaluation

When third-party carriers provide verified LCA data, procurement teams gain a more accurate view of supplier performance and compliance.

### Warehouse energy optimization

LCAs include the energy and material footprint of storage and handling facilities, making operational energy use part of the same dataset as transport impacts.

## 5. Why this matters now

Logistics is rapidly becoming a regulatory and reputational focal point.\
Governments and clients are requiring transparency under frameworks such as:

- **EU CSRD** (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)
- **ISO 14083** for greenhouse gas quantification in transport chains
- **GHG Protocol Scope 3** for value chain emissions reporting

LCAs provide the verified, traceable data these frameworks demand — and help logistics departments get ahead of compliance rather than react to it later.

> Transparency isn’t a marketing feature anymore; it’s a license to operate.

## 7. The shift in logistics thinking

| Traditional View                 | LCA-Informed View                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Our job is to move goods fast.” | “Our job is to move goods efficiently and responsibly.” |
| Focus on fuel and freight cost   | Focus on total lifecycle cost and emissions.            |
| Reporting on averages            | Reporting on verified, route-specific data.             |
| Reactive optimization            | Predictive scenario planning.                           |

This shift doesn’t slow logistics down — it makes it smarter.\
It connects operational performance with sustainability strategy, bridging two functions that rarely spoke the same language.

## Final thought

LCAs don’t change what logistics teams do — they change **how deeply** they understand it.\
By quantifying the real environmental cost of every shipment, warehouse, and packaging choice, they turn logistics from a reactive service into a strategic, measurable asset.

With **Sustainly**, logistics departments can integrate lifecycle insight into everyday operations — transforming movement into measurable value.

> 🚚 **Key takeaway:** Efficiency tells you how fast you move. LCA tells you how wisely.
