> 💬 “You can’t manage what you can’t measure — and in supply chains, measurement starts with LCA.”

Global supply chains account for up to **90% of many companies’ environmental footprint** — including Scope 3 emissions, according to CDP (2023).  
Yet most organizations still lack the visibility to understand where those impacts occur, or how to manage them effectively.

**Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** provides the scientific, data-driven foundation to uncover the environmental cost of every product, process, and supplier relationship — transforming supply chain management from reactive logistics into **strategic sustainability intelligence**.

---

## Why supply chain leaders need LCA
Traditional supply chain metrics (cost, quality, delivery) no longer tell the full story.  
As sustainability regulations like the **EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)** and **CSRD** expand, organizations must now track environmental and social performance throughout their supply networks.  

LCA complements and strengthens supply chain management by:
- Quantifying **Scope 3 emissions** and embodied carbon.  
- Identifying **high-impact suppliers and materials**.  
- Supporting **eco-design and procurement optimization**.  
- Enabling **data-based collaboration** with partners.  

| Supply Chain Challenge | How LCA Solves It |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Limited visibility across suppliers | Quantifies environmental impacts along the full value chain |
| Rising compliance pressure | Provides verified, auditable impact data |
| Cost vs. sustainability trade-offs | Reveals lifecycle efficiency and cost-saving opportunities |
| Supplier inconsistency | Enables performance-based supplier comparison |

> 💡 **Fact:** The World Economic Forum estimates that decarbonizing global supply chains could reduce total emissions by **40%**, if supported by lifecycle data.

## 4 ways LCAs create measurable value in supply chain management

### 1. **End-to-end environmental visibility**
LCAs track environmental impact from raw material extraction to disposal — mapping emissions, resource use, and waste across every stage.  
This allows companies to:
- Identify hotspots across their upstream and downstream flows.  
- Prioritize supplier engagement where impact is highest.  
- Create a fact-based foundation for Scope 3 emissions reporting.  

> ⚙️ **Example:** A 2022 Deloitte study found that companies using LCA-based supply chain mapping achieved **32% greater accuracy** in carbon accounting than those using spend-based estimations.

---

### 2. **Supplier selection and performance management**
LCA data can be integrated into supplier evaluation processes, helping procurement teams move beyond cost-driven decisions to **impact-aware sourcing**.

- Compare suppliers using verified environmental product data (EPDs).  
- Require LCA documentation as part of tender criteria.  
- Set measurable sustainability KPIs in supplier contracts.  

| Metric | Supplier A | Supplier B |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| CO₂e per product unit | 9.8 kg | 5.6 kg |
| Recycled content (%) | 10% | 35% |
| Energy intensity (MJ/kg) | 42 | 29 |

> 💡 **Fact:** According to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), only **38%** of global suppliers currently disclose full emissions data — making LCA-backed documentation a key differentiator for reliable partners.

---

### 3. **Risk reduction and compliance readiness**
Regulations such as the **EU Green Claims Directive**, **CSDDD**, and **German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG)** are enforcing stricter transparency and accountability across supply networks.  

LCA helps organizations:
- Provide **traceable, third-party verifiable data** for audits.  
- Demonstrate compliance with **EN 15804**, **ISO 14040**, and **ISO 14044**.  
- Anticipate regulatory changes by having a quantifiable data foundation.  

<Callout icon="shield-check" color="#22C55E">
  LCA documentation turns sustainability compliance from a risk into a competitive advantage.
</Callout>

> ⚙️ **Fact:** In 2024, over **60% of EU procurement tenders** included sustainability criteria referencing lifecycle or environmental footprint data (European Commission, 2024).

---

### 4. **Efficiency and cost optimization**
LCAs don’t just reveal emissions — they reveal **inefficiencies**.  
By mapping environmental performance to process data, supply chain teams can identify waste, redundant transport, and energy-heavy materials that drive both emissions and cost.  

Practical benefits include:
- Lower energy and logistics costs through optimized routing or material choices.  
- Reduced waste and improved recycling rates.  
- Greater ROI from sustainability initiatives.  

> 💬 “When sustainability and efficiency use the same dataset, business performance follows.”

## Practical steps for implementing LCA in supply chain strategy
| Step | Action | Outcome |
|------|---------|----------|
| **1. Map your value chain** | Identify major material flows and supplier tiers. | Establish system boundaries for LCA. |
| **2. Collect impact data** | Request EPDs or LCA documentation from suppliers. | Build verified impact database. |
| **3. Analyze hotspots** | Use LCA results to locate high-emission stages. | Prioritize mitigation actions. |
| **4. Engage suppliers** | Share findings and co-develop reduction plans. | Foster collaboration and improvement. |
| **5. Report and improve** | Integrate results into ESG and CSRD disclosures. | Demonstrate measurable progress. |

<Tip>Start with key suppliers and materials — 80% of supply chain impact often comes from just 20% of inputs.</Tip>

## KPIs supply chain teams can track with LCA
| KPI | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **% of suppliers with verified LCA data** | Measures transparency maturity. |
| **Average CO₂e per product category** | Tracks efficiency improvements. |
| **Scope 3 coverage rate** | Indicates progress toward complete value chain reporting. |
| **Supplier improvement rate** | Monitors year-over-year performance. |
| **Compliance readiness index** | Quantifies regulatory resilience. |

## Common misconceptions about LCA in supply chains
| Misconception | Reality |
|----------------|----------|
| “LCA is only for finished products.” | Modern LCAs assess materials, suppliers, and logistics too. |
| “It’s too complex to scale.” | Automation platforms like Sustainly make LCA scalable across suppliers. |
| “We already have ESG data.” | LCA provides the verified, product-level detail ESG frameworks require. |
| “It’s only for large corporations.” | SMEs benefit from LCA by securing supplier credibility and access to green tenders. |

## FAQ — LCA for supply chain management

**Q: How does LCA differ from carbon accounting?**  
LCA goes beyond emissions — it assesses water use, waste, and resource depletion across the full lifecycle, offering a more complete sustainability picture.  

**Q: Can suppliers without LCA capabilities still participate?**  
Yes. Sustainly helps suppliers build simplified LCAs using available data, gradually improving data quality and comparability.  

**Q: Is LCA recognized by regulators?**  
Yes. LCA standards (ISO 14040/44, EN 15804, EF 3.1) are the foundation for EU and global environmental reporting frameworks.
