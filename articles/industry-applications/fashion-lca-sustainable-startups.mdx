> 👗 New fashion labels are rethinking sustainability from the ground up — yet few use the most powerful tool available: **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**.  
> For young initiatives, integrating LCAs early means every design, supplier choice, and material can be justified with real environmental data.

## Why Fashion Startups Should Begin with LCAs

The fashion sector accounts for roughly **10% of global carbon emissions** and **20% of wastewater**, according to the UN Environment Programme.  
Small brands entering this space face two pressures: **to differentiate through sustainability** and **to meet tightening EU regulations**.

A **Life Cycle Assessment** provides quantifiable evidence of impact — covering everything from raw fiber production to end-of-life. For new labels, this data is essential to avoid greenwashing and to prove credibility to retailers, investors, and consumers.

By embedding LCAs early, startups can design products with verified environmental performance instead of relying on assumptions or supplier claims.

## What an LCA Covers in Fashion

| Stage | Typical Environmental Factors |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 🌾 Raw Materials | Fiber cultivation, chemical use, and energy inputs |
| 🧵 Manufacturing | Dyeing, finishing, energy consumption, waste generation |
| 🚚 Distribution | Transport emissions and packaging materials |
| 👚 Use Phase | Washing, drying, and product longevity |
| ♻️ End of Life | Reuse, recycling, or landfill disposal impacts |

> These stages often reveal unexpected hotspots — such as water-intensive dyeing processes or emissions from transport logistics.

## The Emerging Advantage: Simpler, Smarter LCAs

Traditional tools like SimaPro or GaBi were built for large enterprises with in-house experts.  
Today, **AI-assisted tools such as Sustainly** allow small teams to conduct LCAs with minimal training, automatically sourcing and structuring data from standard impact methods (EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016).

| Challenge | Traditional Tools | With Sustainly |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Cost | High license fees | Affordable subscription |
| Expertise | Specialist knowledge required | AI-assisted setup and templates |
| Time | Manual data collection | Automated data mapping |
| Integration | Standalone use | Connects with PLM, ERP, or APIs |

<Tip>For startups, this accessibility transforms LCAs from a costly compliance tool into a strategic design advantage.</Tip>

## How Young Brands Use LCAs in Practice

### 1. **Material Evaluation**
Choosing between organic cotton, recycled polyester, or Tencel requires quantified comparisons. LCAs show differences in carbon footprint, energy demand, and water use — not just marketing claims.

### 2. **Supplier Assessment**
LCAs allow small brands to evaluate supply chain partners transparently. By linking supplier data into models, teams can identify where emissions or waste reduction matter most.

### 3. **Regulatory Compliance**
Upcoming EU rules — especially the **Green Claims Directive** and **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)** framework — require evidence for environmental statements.  
Brands using LCAs are already aligned with these standards.

## Getting Started with an LCA as a New Fashion Label

1. **Map your product lifecycle** — include fiber, fabric, manufacturing, packaging, transport, and disposal.  
2. **Gather basic data** — material weights, energy use, transport distance, and supplier info.  
3. **Select an impact method** — EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016 are common European standards.  
4. **Use an automated platform** like **Sustainly** to structure data and calculate impacts.  
5. **Interpret results** — identify the most significant contributors and set measurable reduction goals.

LCAs can be updated over time — as the brand grows, new data improves precision and strengthens claims.

## The Strategic Value for New Entrants

- **Transparency builds trust** — Consumers and buyers expect clear data, not generic eco-labels.  
- **Regulatory alignment** — Early adoption of LCAs prepares brands for EU disclosure laws.  
- **Operational efficiency** — Identifying material and process hotspots reduces waste and costs.  
- **Investor credibility** — Verified impact data signals readiness for responsible funding and partnerships.
