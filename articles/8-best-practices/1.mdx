Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are under increasing pressure to measure and reduce their environmental impact ‚Äî but few have the time or budget for complex sustainability tools. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) offers a structured way to understand product footprints, yet it often seems out of reach.

That‚Äôs changing. With accessible tools like **Sustainly**, LCAs can now be performed faster, cheaper, and more accurately ‚Äî even without a full-time sustainability expert.

Below are five best practices every small company can follow to make LCAs both practical and impactful.

---

## 1. Start Small, Think Big

Many SMEs delay LCAs because they fear the process will be too complex. The key is to **begin with one product or service**, gather basic data, and scale gradually.

Start with a simple **screening LCA** using automated tools such as **Sustainly**, which can generate credible results in hours, not weeks. Once you gain confidence, expand to a full LCA across your product range.

> üí° _Tip:_ Focus on your best-selling or most resource-intensive product first ‚Äî that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find the biggest wins.

## 2. Use Digital Tools to Automate Data Collection

Manual data entry can consume up to 60% of LCA time. Instead, leverage digital platforms that connect directly with your existing systems (e.g., ERP, PLM, or spreadsheets).

Sustainly‚Äôs **AI-driven data mapping** automatically fills in missing values and ensures **compliance with EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, and ReCiPe 2016** methods ‚Äî removing the guesswork from sustainability reporting.

> üöÄ Automation not only saves time but also ensures accuracy, consistency, and repeatability across future assessments.

## 3. Prioritize Transparency Over Perfection

LCAs are about **learning and improving**, not perfection. Small companies shouldn‚Äôt fear publishing initial results, even if the data isn‚Äôt 100% complete.

Being transparent about assumptions builds credibility with customers and suppliers ‚Äî and often sparks collaboration to fill in data gaps.

Sustainly makes transparency easy by offering **auto-generated LCA reports and verifier-ready exports (EN 15804)** to share with stakeholders or certifiers.

---

## 4. Integrate LCAs Into Everyday Decision-Making

Treat your LCA as a **living tool**, not a one-off report. Use the insights to guide product design, supplier selection, and marketing decisions.

By integrating LCA dashboards into your regular workflows (through APIs or collaborative workspaces), teams can see the environmental consequences of every change ‚Äî in real time.

> üåç _Sustainly‚Äôs collaborative features_ allow everyone from procurement to product designers to contribute sustainably.

## 5. Choose Scalable, Affordable Software

Traditional LCA tools like SimaPro or GaBi are powerful but can be prohibitively expensive and require training. For SMEs, the best choice is **software that grows with your needs** ‚Äî affordable, intuitive, and automation-ready.

That‚Äôs where **Sustainly** stands out:

- **Affordable pricing** for small businesses
- **AI automation** that minimizes manual work
- **Scalable workflows** for future EPDs and regulatory compliance

Start simple. Stay scalable. That‚Äôs sustainable.
