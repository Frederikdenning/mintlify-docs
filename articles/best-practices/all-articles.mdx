## 5 Best Practices for LCAs in SMEs

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are under increasing pressure to measure and reduce their environmental impact — but few have the time or budget for complex sustainability tools. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) offers a structured way to understand product footprints, yet it often seems out of reach.

That’s changing. With accessible tools like **Sustainly**, LCAs can now be performed faster, cheaper, and more accurately — even without a full-time sustainability expert.

Below are five best practices every small company can follow to make LCAs both practical and impactful.

---

### 1. Start Small, Think Big

Many SMEs delay LCAs because they fear the process will be too complex. The key is to **begin with one product or service**, gather basic data, and scale gradually.

Start with a simple **screening LCA** using automated tools such as **Sustainly**, which can generate credible results in hours, not weeks. Once you gain confidence, expand to a full LCA across your product range.

> 💡 _Tip:_ Focus on your best-selling or most resource-intensive product first — that’s where you’ll find the biggest wins.

---

### 2. Use Digital Tools to Automate Data Collection

Manual data entry can consume up to 60% of LCA time. Instead, leverage digital platforms that connect directly with your existing systems (e.g., ERP, PLM, or spreadsheets).

Sustainly’s **AI-driven data mapping** automatically fills in missing values and ensures **compliance with EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, and ReCiPe 2016** methods — removing the guesswork from sustainability reporting.

> 🚀 Automation not only saves time but also ensures accuracy, consistency, and repeatability across future assessments.

---

### 3. Prioritize Transparency Over Perfection

LCAs are about **learning and improving**, not perfection. Small companies shouldn’t fear publishing initial results, even if the data isn’t 100% complete.

Being transparent about assumptions builds credibility with customers and suppliers — and often sparks collaboration to fill in data gaps.

Sustainly makes transparency easy by offering **auto-generated LCA reports and verifier-ready exports (EN 15804)** to share with stakeholders or certifiers.

---

### 4. Integrate LCAs Into Everyday Decision-Making

Treat your LCA as a **living tool**, not a one-off report. Use the insights to guide product design, supplier selection, and marketing decisions.

By integrating LCA dashboards into your regular workflows (through APIs or collaborative workspaces), teams can see the environmental consequences of every change — in real time.

> 🌍 _Sustainly’s collaborative features_ allow everyone from procurement to product designers to contribute sustainably.

---

### 5. Choose Scalable, Affordable Software

Traditional LCA tools like SimaPro or GaBi are powerful but can be prohibitively expensive and require training. For SMEs, the best choice is **software that grows with your needs** — affordable, intuitive, and automation-ready.

That’s where **Sustainly** stands out:

- **Affordable pricing** for small businesses
- **AI automation** that minimizes manual work
- **Scalable workflows** for future EPDs and regulatory compliance

Start simple. Stay scalable. That’s sustainable.

## Best Practices for Managing LCA Data Quality

---

> “In sustainability, bad data is worse than no data.”\
> 💬 _Quality LCA data isn’t about quantity — it’s about precision, traceability, and consistency._

---

### Why Data Quality Defines LCA Reliability

A Life Cycle Assessment is only as credible as the data behind it.\
Even the most advanced modeling or AI-driven tools cannot compensate for poor-quality input.

High-quality data ensures:

- Accurate and comparable results
- Lower verification costs
- Stronger compliance with standards like **ISO 14044** and **EN 15804**
- Better decision-making for eco-design and sourcing

Yet many organizations still underestimate how fragmented or outdated their data is — especially when LCAs are run across multiple product lines.

---

### 1. Define Clear Data Quality Requirements

Start by defining what _“good data”_ means for your organization.\
Without criteria, quality becomes subjective and inconsistencies multiply.

**Use the five standard data quality dimensions:**

| Dimension         | Description                                  | Example                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technological** | Match between process and dataset technology | Using composite material data for steel parts = ❌ |
| **Geographical**  | Relevance to location of production          | Using global electricity data for Denmark = ❌     |
| **Temporal**      | Age of the data                              | Using datasets older than 5 years = 🚫            |
| **Completeness**  | Percentage of processes covered              | Missing transport or packaging data = ⚠️          |
| **Reliability**   | Verified source and methodology              | Peer-reviewed data = ✅                            |

<Info>
  Document these criteria in your internal “LCA Data Quality Matrix.” Sustainly includes customizable templates for this.
</Info>

---

### 2. Prioritize Primary Data Collection

Secondary databases (like **ecoinvent** or **EF 3.1**) are valuable, but **primary company data** — direct measurements from production, logistics, or suppliers — always improves precision.

> 💡 **Tip:** Begin by identifying which 20% of data contributes to 80% of your impact — then focus collection there.

**Examples of high-impact primary data:**

- Energy and material consumption in manufacturing
- Transport distances and modes
- Supplier energy sources
- Packaging types and weights

Sustainly’s **ERP and supplier integrations** help automate this collection process, ensuring updates stay continuous rather than manual.

---

### 3. Automate Data Validation and Consistency Checks

Manual validation leads to human error and inconsistency.\
Automation ensures your data is checked _before_ it enters the model.

<Info>
  Automated QA routines can detect missing values, mismatched units, or outdated datasets within seconds.
</Info>

**Best practice:**

- Set automated alerts for outdated datasets (\>5 years old)
- Use consistency checks between materials and processes (e.g., no plastic injection without polymer input)
- Track version control for every dataset update

With **Sustainly**, data consistency checks run automatically across every imported file or API input — keeping portfolio models synchronized.

---

### 4. Maintain a Centralized Data Repository

A shared data repository is the backbone of quality management.\
When analysts use local copies or spreadsheets, discrepancies become inevitable.

> 🧠 _A centralized data hub transforms your LCA practice from reactive to scalable._

| Feature             | Why It Matters                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🗂️ Central storage | Prevents data duplication         |
| 🔄 Version control  | Tracks every change               |
| 🔍 Data lineage     | Shows who changed what and why    |
| 👥 Access roles     | Ensures accountability and review |

Sustainly provides **team-based data governance**, so sustainability teams can maintain clarity across hundreds of LCAs without confusion.

---

### 5. Review and Update Regularly

Even the cleanest dataset decays over time.\
Supply chains shift, production processes evolve, and regulatory methods get updated.

**Set up a review cycle:**

- **Quarterly:** Check primary data accuracy.
- **Annually:** Update background datasets (ecoinvent, EF 3.1).
- **Every 2 years:** Recalibrate impact assessment methods (IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016).

<Warning>
  Using outdated data can invalidate compliance with EPD or ISO standards — even if models are technically correct.
</Warning>

> 💡 Sustainly automatically flags expired datasets and recommends updated versions, keeping every assessment aligned with current standards.

## Best Practices for Scaling LCAs Across Product Portfolios
---

> “A single LCA tells a story — scaling LCAs builds an entire sustainability language.”  
> 💬 *The challenge? Keeping accuracy, speed, and clarity aligned.*

---

### Why Scaling LCAs Is So Hard

Most sustainability teams start small — one LCA for one flagship product.  
But as organizations grow, that *one* turns into *hundreds* or *thousands* of products needing comparable environmental data.  

Without a scalable system, teams face:
- Weeks spent repeating manual data collection  
- Inconsistent models across analysts  
- Difficulty verifying or comparing results  

That’s why scaling LCAs isn’t just about *doing more* — it’s about **building a repeatable, automated process**.

---

### 1. Standardize Methods and Frameworks

Before scaling, consistency is everything.  
Different analysts using different methods (e.g., IPCC 2021 vs. ReCiPe 2016) will make portfolio comparisons meaningless.

<Callout icon="settings" color="#22C55E">
Create a shared LCA framework for all team members: same databases, methods, and allocation rules.
</Callout>

**Best practice checklist:**
- Define one **impact method** (EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016).  
- Choose a consistent **allocation approach** (Cut-off or Consequential).  
- Set standardized **system boundaries** and **functional units**.  
- Document these choices in a central “LCA playbook.”  

---

### 2. Automate Data Collection and Model Building

Manual LCAs don’t scale — automation does.

Sustainability teams waste enormous time gathering process data, matching suppliers, and entering logistics info manually.  
Modern AI tools like **Sustainly** automatically:
- Connect to **ERP or PLM systems**  
- Detect **product-level material compositions**  
- Suggest **matching background datasets**  
- Build **pre-verified LCA models** instantly  

<Callout icon="sparkles" color="#22C55E">
Automation doesn’t replace expertise — it amplifies it.
</Callout>

---

### 3. Centralize Data for Consistency

Scalability depends on *reusability*.  
When every LCA analyst starts from scratch, data chaos spreads quickly.

> 💡 **Tip:** Store all datasets, assumptions, and models in a shared, version-controlled database.  

| Element | Best Practice |
|----------|----------------|
| 📁 Project Templates | Pre-configure LCA goals, boundaries, and databases |
| 🔄 Version Control | Track model iterations and updates |
| 🧾 Data Governance | Assign roles for who can approve or modify datasets |

Sustainly provides this via **collaborative project workspaces** — ensuring everyone works on the same, validated data foundation.

---

### 4. Establish Quality Control Workflows

Scaling without control creates noise.  
Every LCA should undergo **peer review or verifier review**, even in automated contexts.

**Include these QA steps:**
1. Automated data consistency check.  
2. Peer or verifier validation (EN 15804, ISO 14044).  
3. Documentation of all assumptions and changes.  

> 🧠 The goal: *Each new LCA is faster — but never less credible.*

---

### 5. Communicate at Portfolio Level

Once your LCAs are scalable, insights should scale too.  
Don’t just show product-by-product impacts; visualize category averages or improvement trends.

**Best practice:**
- Use dashboards to track hotspots across product lines.  
- Benchmark materials, suppliers, or processes.  
- Integrate with ESG or EPD workflows for consistent public reporting.  

Sustainly includes **portfolio-level analytics** — transforming raw data into strategic sustainability insights.

---

### Quick Recap

| Step | Focus | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1️⃣ | Standardize methods | Ensure comparability |
| 2️⃣ | Automate workflows | Save time and reduce errors |
| 3️⃣ | Centralize data | Improve collaboration |
| 4️⃣ | Control quality | Maintain credibility |
| 5️⃣ | Visualize results | Drive strategic action |

---

### Common Pitfalls When Scaling LCAs

- ❌ Treating each LCA as a standalone project  
- ❌ Lacking documentation or version control  
- ❌ Relying on manual spreadsheets for modeling  
- ❌ Ignoring verifier review when scaling speed  

<Warning>Scaling fast without structure leads to inconsistent, unverifiable LCAs — and wasted effort.</Warning>

---

### Conclusion

Scaling LCAs isn’t just about capacity — it’s about **building an ecosystem of trust, transparency, and efficiency**.  
By combining automation with good data governance, sustainability teams can go from a handful of product LCAs to a complete, actionable footprint library.

## Best Practices for Transparent and Credible LCA Reporting
---

> “Transparency turns numbers into trust.”  
> 💬 *The value of an LCA lies not just in its calculation, but in how clearly it’s communicated.*

---

### Why Transparency Is a Competitive Advantage

Companies today face a new kind of challenge: not just *doing* sustainability, but *proving* it.  
Regulators, customers, and investors all want **evidence-based environmental data** — verified, reproducible, and compliant.

A transparent LCA report does more than tick a box.  
It helps:
- Build credibility in sustainability claims  
- Streamline verifier approval for EPDs  
- Strengthen ESG and supplier communication  
- Prepare for upcoming regulations like **CSRD** and **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)**  

---

### 1. Start With a Clear Reporting Framework

Every credible LCA report follows a structure.  
Start by defining what audiences (verifiers, customers, regulators) need to know.

<Callout icon="clipboard" color="#22C55E">
Use frameworks like **ISO 14044**, **EN 15804**, or **PEFCRs** to define your report structure — even for internal use.
</Callout>

**Include these sections:**
1. Goal and scope  
2. System boundaries and functional unit  
3. Data quality and sources  
4. Impact assessment methods  
5. Results interpretation and sensitivity analysis  
6. Limitations and recommendations  

> 💡 **Tip:** Sustainly’s LCA templates include built-in EN 15804-compliant report structures, saving hours of formatting and documentation.

---

### 2. Document Every Assumption and Source

Transparency lives in the details.  
Auditors and partners don’t just look at numbers — they look at *how* those numbers were generated.

**Best practice:**  
- Record every **data source**, **assumption**, and **calculation rule**.  
- Use consistent referencing (dataset version, publication year, source database).  
- Distinguish **primary data** (company-provided) from **secondary data** (database-derived).  

| Data Type | Example | Traceability Tip |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Primary | Supplier energy mix, material weights | Include source name and collection date |
| Secondary | ecoinvent or EF 3.1 data | Add database version and process ID |

<Callout icon="document" color="#22C55E">
With Sustainly, all assumptions and data points are automatically logged — creating a full audit trail for verifiers.
</Callout>

---

### 3. Be Honest About Uncertainties

No dataset is perfect.  
But concealing uncertainty damages credibility faster than acknowledging it.

> 🧠 *A transparent range beats a misleading single number.*

**How to express uncertainty clearly:**
- Use sensitivity analysis to show impact variability.  
- Describe known data gaps or limitations.  
- Avoid “absolute” claims — use comparative or scenario-based language.  

<Warning>Never present LCA results as final truths; they’re modeled representations of a defined system under specific assumptions.</Warning>

---

### 4. Use Visuals to Simplify Complexity

Most readers won’t interpret impact categories or midpoints intuitively.  
Visuals make LCAs understandable — and help decision-makers take action.

**Effective visualizations:**
- **Contribution analysis charts** (which stages cause most impact)  
- **Hotspot maps** for supply chain visualization  
- **Comparison bars** for before/after design changes  
- **Portfolio dashboards** to show improvement over time  

> 💡 Sustainly automatically generates verifier-ready graphs and exportable dashboards — ready for internal presentations or EPD publication.

---

### 5. Facilitate Verification and Reuse

Transparency isn’t only about openness — it’s also about *reusability*.  
When verifiers or partners can easily trace your methodology, review time drops significantly.

**Verification-ready reporting includes:**
- Clear version control and change logs  
- Linked datasets (no hidden data sources)  
- Method references (EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016)  
- Export formats compatible with EPD systems (e.g., ILCD+EPD XML)  

<Callout icon="check" color="#22C55E">
Sustainly provides verifier access portals for direct review — reducing manual back-and-forth during EPD approval.
</Callout>

---

### Quick Recap

| Step | Action | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 1️⃣ | Follow a reporting framework | Ensures consistency |
| 2️⃣ | Document assumptions | Enables verification |
| 3️⃣ | Communicate uncertainty | Builds trust |
| 4️⃣ | Visualize results | Improves understanding |
| 5️⃣ | Enable verification | Simplifies EPD workflows |

---

### Common Reporting Mistakes

- ❌ Omitting data sources or assuming “common knowledge.”  
- ❌ Mixing results from different impact methods.  
- ❌ Presenting selective results to appear greener.  
- ❌ Neglecting to update documentation after data revisions.  

> 🧩 **Transparency isn’t bureaucracy — it’s credibility.**

---

### Conclusion

Transparent reporting is the foundation of trustworthy sustainability communication.  
By combining clear frameworks, consistent documentation, and AI-assisted traceability, sustainability teams can confidently publish LCAs that withstand scrutiny — and inspire real change.
