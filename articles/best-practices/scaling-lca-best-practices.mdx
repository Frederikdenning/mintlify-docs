## Why Scaling LCAs Is So Hard

Most sustainability teams start small ‚Äî one LCA for one flagship product.  
But as organizations grow, that *one* turns into *hundreds* or *thousands* of products needing comparable environmental data.  

Without a scalable system, teams face:
- Weeks spent repeating manual data collection  
- Inconsistent models across analysts  
- Difficulty verifying or comparing results  

That‚Äôs why scaling LCAs isn‚Äôt just about *doing more* ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **building a repeatable, automated process**.

## 1. Standardize Methods and Frameworks

Before scaling, consistency is everything.  
Different analysts using different methods (e.g., IPCC 2021 vs. ReCiPe 2016) will make portfolio comparisons meaningless.

Create a shared LCA framework for all team members: same databases, methods, and allocation rules.
</Callout>

**Best practice checklist:**
- Define one **impact method** (EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016).  
- Choose a consistent **allocation approach** (Cut-off or Consequential).  
- Set standardized **system boundaries** and **functional units**.  
- Document these choices in a central ‚ÄúLCA playbook.‚Äù

## 2. Automate Data Collection and Model Building

Manual LCAs don‚Äôt scale ‚Äî automation does.

Sustainability teams waste enormous time gathering process data, matching suppliers, and entering logistics info manually.  
Modern AI tools like **Sustainly** automatically:
- Connect to **ERP or PLM systems**  
- Detect **product-level material compositions**  
- Suggest **matching background datasets**  
- Build **pre-verified LCA models** instantly

Automation doesn‚Äôt replace expertise ‚Äî it amplifies it.

## 3. Centralize Data for Consistency

Scalability depends on *reusability*.  
When every LCA analyst starts from scratch, data chaos spreads quickly.

> üí° **Tip:** Store all datasets, assumptions, and models in a shared, version-controlled database.  

| Element | Best Practice |
|----------|----------------|
| üìÅ Project Templates | Pre-configure LCA goals, boundaries, and databases |
| üîÑ Version Control | Track model iterations and updates |
| üßæ Data Governance | Assign roles for who can approve or modify datasets |

Sustainly provides this via **collaborative project workspaces** ‚Äî ensuring everyone works on the same, validated data foundation.

## 4. Establish Quality Control Workflows

Scaling without control creates noise.  
Every LCA should undergo **peer review or verifier review**, even in automated contexts.

**Include these QA steps:**
1. Automated data consistency check.  
2. Peer or verifier validation (EN 15804, ISO 14044).  
3. Documentation of all assumptions and changes.  

> üß† The goal: *Each new LCA is faster ‚Äî but never less credible.*

---

## 5. Communicate at Portfolio Level

Once your LCAs are scalable, insights should scale too.  
Don‚Äôt just show product-by-product impacts; visualize category averages or improvement trends.

**Best practice:**
- Use dashboards to track hotspots across product lines.  
- Benchmark materials, suppliers, or processes.  
- Integrate with ESG or EPD workflows for consistent public reporting.  

Sustainly includes **portfolio-level analytics** ‚Äî transforming raw data into strategic sustainability insights.

## Common Pitfalls When Scaling LCAs

- ‚ùå Treating each LCA as a standalone project  
- ‚ùå Lacking documentation or version control  
- ‚ùå Relying on manual spreadsheets for modeling  
- ‚ùå Ignoring verifier review when scaling speed  

<Warning>Scaling fast without structure leads to inconsistent, unverifiable LCAs ‚Äî and wasted effort.</Warning>

## Conclusion

Scaling LCAs isn‚Äôt just about capacity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **building an ecosystem of trust, transparency, and efficiency**.  
By combining automation with good data governance, sustainability teams can go from a handful of product LCAs to a complete, actionable footprint library.
