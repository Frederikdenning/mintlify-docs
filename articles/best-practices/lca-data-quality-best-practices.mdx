## Why Data Quality Defines LCA Reliability

A Life Cycle Assessment is only as credible as the data behind it.\
Even the most advanced modeling or AI-driven tools cannot compensate for poor-quality input.

High-quality data ensures:

- Accurate and comparable results
- Lower verification costs
- Stronger compliance with standards like **ISO 14044** and **EN 15804**
- Better decision-making for eco-design and sourcing

Yet many organizations still underestimate how fragmented or outdated their data is — especially when LCAs are run across multiple product lines.

## 1. Define Clear Data Quality Requirements

Start by defining what _“good data”_ means for your organization.\
Without criteria, quality becomes subjective and inconsistencies multiply.

**Use the five standard data quality dimensions:**

| Dimension         | Description                                  | Example                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technological** | Match between process and dataset technology | Using composite material data for steel parts = ❌ |
| **Geographical**  | Relevance to location of production          | Using global electricity data for Denmark = ❌     |
| **Temporal**      | Age of the data                              | Using datasets older than 5 years = 🚫            |
| **Completeness**  | Percentage of processes covered              | Missing transport or packaging data = ⚠️          |
| **Reliability**   | Verified source and methodology              | Peer-reviewed data = ✅                            |

<Info>
  Document these criteria in your internal “LCA Data Quality Matrix.” Sustainly includes customizable templates for this.

## 2. Prioritize Primary Data Collection

Secondary databases (like **ecoinvent** or **EF 3.1**) are valuable, but **primary company data** — direct measurements from production, logistics, or suppliers — always improves precision.

> 💡 **Tip:** Begin by identifying which 20% of data contributes to 80% of your impact — then focus collection there.

**Examples of high-impact primary data:**

- Energy and material consumption in manufacturing
- Transport distances and modes
- Supplier energy sources
- Packaging types and weights

Sustainly’s **ERP and supplier integrations** help automate this collection process, ensuring updates stay continuous rather than manual.

## 3. Automate Data Validation and Consistency Checks

Manual validation leads to human error and inconsistency.\
Automation ensures your data is checked _before_ it enters the model.

<Info>
  Automated QA routines can detect missing values, mismatched units, or outdated datasets within seconds.
</Info>

**Best practice:**

- Set automated alerts for outdated datasets (\>5 years old)
- Use consistency checks between materials and processes (e.g., no plastic injection without polymer input)
- Track version control for every dataset update

With **Sustainly**, data consistency checks run automatically across every imported file or API input — keeping portfolio models synchronized.

## 4. Maintain a Centralized Data Repository

A shared data repository is the backbone of quality management.\
When analysts use local copies or spreadsheets, discrepancies become inevitable.

> 🧠 _A centralized data hub transforms your LCA practice from reactive to scalable._

| Feature             | Why It Matters                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🗂️ Central storage | Prevents data duplication         |
| 🔄 Version control  | Tracks every change               |
| 🔍 Data lineage     | Shows who changed what and why    |
| 👥 Access roles     | Ensures accountability and review |

Sustainly provides **team-based data governance**, so sustainability teams can maintain clarity across hundreds of LCAs without confusion.

---

## 5. Review and Update Regularly

Even the cleanest dataset decays over time.\
Supply chains shift, production processes evolve, and regulatory methods get updated.

**Set up a review cycle:**

- **Quarterly:** Check primary data accuracy.
- **Annually:** Update background datasets (ecoinvent, EF 3.1).
- **Every 2 years:** Recalibrate impact assessment methods (IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016).

<Warning>
  Using outdated data can invalidate compliance with EPD or ISO standards — even if models are technically correct.
</Warning>

> 💡 Sustainly automatically flags expired datasets and recommends updated versions, keeping every assessment aligned with current standards.

## Quick Recap

| Step | Focus                   | Why It Matters      |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Define quality criteria | Establish clarity   |
| 2️⃣  | Collect primary data    | Improve accuracy    |
| 3️⃣  | Automate validation     | Reduce errors       |
| 4️⃣  | Centralize data         | Ensure consistency  |
| 5️⃣  | Review regularly        | Maintain compliance |

## Common Data Management Pitfalls

- ❌ Mixing datasets from incompatible methods (e.g., ReCiPe + EF 3.1)
- ❌ Using generic data for region-specific products
- ❌ Storing LCA data locally without version control
- ❌ Treating data updates as one-off events

> “Consistency isn’t achieved by accident — it’s maintained by design.”

## Conclusion

Reliable LCA data management is a continuous practice, not a one-time task.\
By defining clear quality rules, automating validation, and maintaining centralized governance, companies can turn LCA data into a strategic sustainability asset.
