End-of-life is often the most overlooked stage in Life Cycle Assessment — but it can **shift the whole result**, especially for packaging, electronics, or fashion.

This guide shows you how to model disposal scenarios properly — and make smarter design choices as a result.

## Why End-of-Life Matters

- It affects impact categories like **climate**, **toxicity**, and **resource use**
- Policies (e.g. **EPR**, **EU waste hierarchy**) increasingly require full-lifecycle claims
- It’s where **circularity** lives: recycling, reuse, remanufacturing

## 4 Common End-of-Life Scenarios

| Scenario        | What to Model                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ♻️ Recycling    | Energy used, material yield, system expansion or avoided burden |
| 🚮 Landfill     | Biogenic vs fossil emissions, leachate (optional)               |
| 🔥 Incineration | Heat recovery, air emissions, substitution effects              |
| 🔁 Reuse        | Cleaning/transport, number of cycles, avoided virgin materials  |

## How to Include It in Your LCA

### Step 1: Choose your system boundary

Most EPDs require **cradle-to-grave** (include end-of-life).\
Cradle-to-gate excludes it.

---

### Step 2: Define your assumptions

- Recycling rate (% of material recovered)
- Loss rate (during collection/sorting)
- Displacement factor (what the recycled material replaces)
- Transport to disposal facility
- Energy or emissions during treatment

---

### Step 3: Model using your tool

✅ Most LCA tools (Sustainly, SimaPro, OpenLCA) offer:

- End-of-life modules
- Country-specific waste data
- Scenario comparison
- Support for **cut-off** or **system expansion** methods

📌 Don’t forget to document assumptions clearly!

## Real Example: PET Bottle

| Scenario                              | Climate Impact |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 100% landfill                         | 120 g CO₂e     |
| 50% recycled                          | 70 g CO₂e      |
| 100% incinerated (w/ energy recovery) | 90 g CO₂e      |

👉 Result: _Designing for recyclability + ensuring infrastructure = major impact difference._

---

## Reporting Tips

- Always specify % by disposal route (e.g. 70% recycling, 30% landfill)
- Use region-specific waste data where possible
- Explain if you’re using **cut-off** or **avoided burden** method
- Include end-of-life sensitivity in decision-making

---

## Final Takeaway

End-of-life modeling brings your LCA full circle — from cradle to grave, or even cradle to cradle.\
Designers, marketers, and regulators all care what happens _after use_.
