Packaging is everywhere — and so are questions about its impact.\
But you don’t need a 6-month study to build a simple, transparent **Packaging LCA**.

## This guide shows you how to go from zero to impact results — in **just one week**.

## What You’ll Need

✅ Basic bill of materials (weight, type, supplier)\
✅ Transport distances (to warehouse or customer)\
✅ Use-phase assumptions (if reusable)\
✅ End-of-life scenarios (landfill, incineration, recycling)

## Step-by-Step Timeline

### 📅 Day 1: Define Your Functional Unit

📌 Example: “Protecting 1 liter of liquid during transport over 300 km”

---

### 📅 Day 2: Map the System

- Primary packaging (e.g. PET bottle)
- Secondary packaging (e.g. cardboard tray)
- Tertiary packaging (e.g. pallet wrap)

Draw a simple flowchart — nothing fancy.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Collect Data

- Material weights from specs
- Recycled content (%)
- Supplier locations and transport mode
- End-of-life estimates (use EU average if unknown)

---

### 📅 Day 4: Build the Model

Use tools like:

- **Sustainly** – fast AI-assisted packaging LCA
- **One Click LCA** – strong for EPD-ready outputs
- **Ecochain Mobius** – design-phase friendly

Enter inputs, choose impact method (e.g. EF 3.1 or ReCiPe), run model.

---

### 📅 Day 5: Interpret Results

Check:

- Material hotspots (usually primary plastic)
- Transport contribution
- End-of-life scenarios

Run **1–2 improvement scenarios**, e.g.:

- PET vs recycled PET
- Film wrap vs reusable crate
- Local vs global supplier

---

## Final Output (for Stakeholders)

- One-pager summary: CO₂e, water use, recyclability
- Sankey or bar chart of impact distribution
- List of trade-offs (e.g. heavier but more recyclable)
- Clear assumptions & boundary notes

## Packaging Questions You Can Now Answer

❓ Is paper _always_ better than plastic?\
❓ When does reusable pay off?\
❓ How much does transport actually matter?\
❓ Should we switch to mono-material packaging?

---

## Final Takeaway

A clear, focused LCA on packaging can be built fast — and reused across SKUs with minor tweaks.
