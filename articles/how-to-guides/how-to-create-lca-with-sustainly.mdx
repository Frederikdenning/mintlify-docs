Creating a **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** used to mean days of manual data gathering and modeling in complex tools. With **Sustainly**, you can generate full, standards-compliant LCAs in minutes — guided by AI and connected to verified environmental databases.

Whether you’re a sustainability lead, product designer, or student, this guide walks you through every step of building your first LCA inside Sustainly.

## 🧭 Step 1: Set up your project

After signing in, you’ll land on the Sustainly dashboard.\
Click **“New Project”** and choose your project type — **Product LCA**, **EPD (EN 15804)**, or **Corporate LCA**.

**Add basic details:**

- Product name and version
- Functional unit (e.g., 1 kg of material or 1 item produced)
- System boundary (Cradle-to-Gate, Cradle-to-Grave, etc.)

<Info>
  Sustainly automatically recommends the right framework and impact method (e.g., EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016) based on your region and goal.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Import or connect your data

You can upload your data manually or connect directly to your systems.

**Three quick ways to import data:**

1. **Manual entry** — enter material and process data directly in the interface.
2. **Spreadsheet upload** — use Sustainly’s CSV template for bulk input.
3. **Automated integration** — connect your **ERP**, **PLM**, or **API** to pull data automatically.

> 💡 **Tip:** Sustainly’s AI detects incomplete or inconsistent datasets and suggests verified proxies from the EU Environmental Footprint or _ecoinvent_.

## 🧩 Step 3: Build your LCA model

Once data is imported, Sustainly builds the process network automatically.\
The AI engine identifies flows (materials, energy, transport) and maps them to the correct background datasets.

**You can:**

- Review and adjust material inputs
- Add custom processes or transport routes
- Select allocation methods (Cut-off, Consequential, or EN 15804)
- Apply circularity scenarios and sensitivity analyses

## 📊 Step 4: Review results and impacts

Click **“Calculate”** and Sustainly generates full impact results across categories like:

- Climate Change (CO₂ eq)
- Acidification
- Eutrophication
- Resource Use
- Water Scarcity

Results are visualized in clean dashboards, showing hotspots and improvement opportunities.

## 🧾 Step 5: Generate reports and share insights

When satisfied with your results, click **“Generate Report.”**\
You can export:

- PDF summary reports for stakeholders
- EN 15804-compliant **EPD files**
- Excel or JSON for deeper data analysis
- Shareable dashboards for verifiers and partners

<Info>
  Sustainly automatically formats your report for verifier access and compliance review.

## 🌱 Bonus: Automate future LCAs

Once your model is complete, reuse it across product versions.\
Sustainly allows **batch LCAs** — instantly comparing thousands of product variants.

> 💡 **Tip:** This is where Sustainly outperforms tools like openLCA or SimaPro — turning weeks of repetitive modeling into a few clicks.
