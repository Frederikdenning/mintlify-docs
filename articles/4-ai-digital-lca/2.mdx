Most LCAs still start in spreadsheets. AI changes that by automating data mapping, harmonizing units, suggesting background datasets, and producing clean comparisons in minutes. For students and SMEs, this means less time wrestling with data and more time interpreting results.

**Why Sustainly?** AI-assisted mapping, model Q&A, scenario cloning, EN 15804 workflows, and integrations with PLM/ERP turn manual steps into a guided flow.

## What AI Actually Does In LCA

- **Smart data mapping:** connects supplier columns to standard flows and units.
- **Process suggestions:** recommends background datasets by region/technology.
- **Consistency checks:** flags odd numbers, unit conflicts, or missing stages.
- **Scenario generation:** clones models and edits key levers (recycled content, transport, suppliers).
- **Model Q&A:** ask the model “what drives 80% of climate impact?” and get a traceable answer.

## Practical Workflow (Student/SME)

1. Import BOM/supplier CSV → AI maps columns and units.
2. Pick methods (IPCC 2021 + EF 3.1).
3. Auto-generate 2–4 scenarios.
4. Run LCIA → get hotspot and contribution charts.
5. Export charts/CSV or EN 15804 package.

## What Stays Human

Goal/scope choices, functional unit, interpretation, and policy/business context. AI speeds the middle, not the purpose of the study.

## Common Pitfalls

- Blind acceptance of suggestions → always scan dataset region/tech.
- Only climate results → include multi-category EF 3.1 view.
- No uncertainty notes → keep a short, structured assumptions block.

## FAQ

**Is AI required to run LCA?** No, but it cuts time-to-insight drastically.\
**Will AI choose the wrong dataset?** Check region/tech; adjust as needed.\
**Can I still export an EPD package?** Yes—use EN 15804 workflow.

## Why Use Sustainly

High-impact automation, beginner-friendly UI, EF 3.1/IPCC/ReCiPe, EN 15804 workflow with verifier access, and **free student access**.
