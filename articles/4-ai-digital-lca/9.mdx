The best LCA tools today don’t just calculate — they think _with_ you.

But with every tool now claiming to be “AI-powered,” which features actually matter?

Here’s our shortlist of the most valuable AI functionalities in modern Life Cycle Assessment platforms.

---

## 🎯 1. Smart Data Input

AI assists in:

- Auto-mapping product BOMs to material databases
- Estimating missing values using industry benchmarks
- Converting messy units (e.g. kg vs g, miles vs km)
- Flagging duplicates or gaps instantly

---

## 🔍 2. Instant Hotspot Analysis

The AI runs your model and instantly shows:

- Top 3 impact drivers
- Suggested improvements (e.g. material swaps)
- Percent contribution per life stage

---

## 📊 3. Report Auto-Generation

From your model, AI drafts:

- One-pager summaries
- Customer-ready PDFs
- Compliance-ready EPD tables
- Charts and graphs for slides or carousels

---

## 🧠 4. Predictive Scenario Suggestions

- What if you switch to 50% recycled material?
- What happens if transport mode changes?
- AI models multiple alternatives and ranks results

---

## 💬 5. Embedded LLM Assistant

Some tools (like **Sustainly**) now integrate a built-in chat assistant that:

- Explains LCA terms in plain language
- Answers regulatory questions (e.g. EF 3.1 scope)
- Guides users step by step through modeling

---

## Final Takeaway

Not all AI is equal. Look for tools that **reduce manual work, prevent errors, and guide decisions** — not just flashy dashboards.
