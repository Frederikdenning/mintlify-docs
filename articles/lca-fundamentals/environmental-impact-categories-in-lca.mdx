In LCA, you don’t just count emissions or waste — you group them into **impact categories** to understand _what they actually do_ to the planet.

This guide explains what impact categories are, why they matter, and how to read them like a pro — even if it’s your first Life Cycle Assessment.

## What Are Impact Categories?

They are **groups of environmental effects** caused by the inputs and outputs in your product system.

Example: CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O are different gases — but all contribute to **climate change**. The category groups them into **CO₂-equivalents (CO₂e)**.

## Common Impact Categories (And What They Mean)

| Category                         | What It Measures               | Typical Unit   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 🌍 Climate change                | Greenhouse gas emissions       | kg CO₂e        |
| 💧 Water use                     | Water consumption & stress     | m³             |
| 🌱 Eutrophication                | Nutrient pollution in water    | kg PO₄³⁻ eq    |
| 🌫️ Acidification                | Acid emissions (SO₂, NOₓ)      | kg SO₂ eq      |
| ☣️ Human toxicity                | Long-term health risks         | CTUh           |
| 🧪 Ecotoxicity                   | Harm to ecosystems             | CTUe           |
| ⛏️ Resource use                  | Fossil fuels, metals, minerals | MJ or kg Sb eq |
| ☀️ Photochemical ozone formation | Smog creation                  | kg NMVOC eq    |

## Why They Matter

- Help identify **trade-offs** (e.g. low CO₂ but high water use)
- Needed for **EPDs** and **EU compliance** (e.g. EF 3.1)
- Go beyond carbon: customers & regulators ask for full impact views
- Enable more **responsible product design**

---

## How Are Impacts Calculated?

1. **Inventory**: You collect all emissions and inputs (kg CO₂, NOₓ, CH₄, kg plastic…)
2. **Characterization**: Convert these into impacts using scientific factors
3. **Normalization & weighting** _(optional)_: Compare against global averages or policy priorities

Most tools do this automatically, using methods like:

- EF 3.1 (EU’s default)
- ReCiPe 2016
- TRACI (USA-focused)
- ILCD

## What to Watch Out For

⚠️ Not all tools use the same methods\
⚠️ You can’t compare different units unless they are in the same category\
⚠️ Single-score “eco index” can hide trade-offs\
⚠️ Always disclose the impact method used

---

## Real Example: Packaging Comparison

| Option                | Climate (CO₂e) | Water Use | Resource Use |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| PET Bottle            | 90 g           | Low       | Medium       |
| Aluminum Can          | 120 g          | High      | High         |
| Recycled Paper Carton | 70 g           | Medium    | Low          |

👉 _Which is better?_ That depends on what impact you want to reduce.

## Final Tip

Don’t just look at CO₂. True sustainability is multi-dimensional. Use impact categories to get the full picture — and design better.
