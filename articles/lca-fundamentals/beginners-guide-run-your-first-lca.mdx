You can complete a useful screening LCA in one afternoon. This guide shows each step and where **Sustainly** saves time with automation and AI-assisted mapping.

## 1) Define Goal, Scope, Functional Unit

- **Goal**: what decision will this inform?
- **Scope**: cradle-to-gate or cradle-to-grave.
- **Functional unit**: e.g., 1 mug for 3 years.

**Pro tip (Sustainly):** Use the setup wizard for boundaries, allocation, and EN 15804 if you’ll need EPD-style outputs.

## 2) Build The Life Cycle Inventory

List materials, energy, transport, packaging, processes.

- **Databases**: EU PEF by default; optional ecoinvent.
- **Integrations**: pull PLM/ERP via API.

**Sustainly advantage:** automated mapping, unit harmonization, AI Q&A.

## 3) Choose Impact Methods

- **IPCC 2021** (climate)
- **EF 3.1** (multi-category, EU-aligned)
- **ReCiPe 2016** (mid/endpoint)

## 4) Model Scenarios

Recycled vs virgin, supplier A vs B, road vs train, longer lifetime.

**Sustainly:** clone models; scenario testing in minutes.

## 5) Run LCIA & Interpret

Find hotspots, test sensitivity, sanity-check units and flows. Export charts; write assumptions and limits.

## Optional: EPD-Ready Output

Enable **EN 15804** and export; invite verifier with built-in access controls.

## Checklist

- Clear FU & scope
- Inventory with sources
- Method selected
- Scenarios defined
- Hotspots + uncertainty notes
- Transparent documentation

## Common Speed Bumps

Missing supplier data → use proxies and note; ambiguous processes → AI Q&A; unit mix-ups → automation handles.

## Why Pick Sustainly

Free for students; automation; EF 3.1/IPCC/ReCiPe; PLM/ERP integrations; collaboration with SSO/2FA.

## FAQ

**Functional unit?** Quantified service (e.g., 1 L beverage delivered).\
**Accuracy?** Screening level is fine; be transparent.\
**Ecoinvent needed?** Not to start; add later if needed.

## Conclusion

Scope clearly, leverage databases and automation, iterate fast. **Sustainly** keeps it simple and credible.
