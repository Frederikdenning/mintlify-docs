## When AI Goes Wrong — and Why It’s Perfect for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

AI is often misused in business, but in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), its data-handling power makes it a game-changer for sustainable decision-making.

---

### The Misuse of AI in Business Contexts

Artificial Intelligence has become the buzzword of modern business strategy. Companies are using AI for **everything** — from content creation to recruitment and customer analytics. But in many cases, it’s used **for the wrong reasons**:

- To cut human oversight too quickly
- To generate output without accountability
- To optimize short-term gains at the expense of long-term value

This often results in _AI washing_ — the practice of using AI as a marketing label without real transparency or scientific backing.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** When AI is used as a _shortcut_ rather than a _system_, it amplifies existing problems — bias, opacity, and misinformation.

In sustainability, this misuse is especially risky. Data integrity and methodological transparency are essential for credibility.\
That’s why AI, when used irresponsibly, can **undermine environmental trust** rather than build it.

---

### Why LCA Is Different: Data Is the Heart of the Problem (and Solution)

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a field where **data is everything**.\
Each product footprint depends on thousands of data points — raw material flows, energy mixes, logistics, emissions factors, and end-of-life scenarios.

Most sustainability teams struggle here:

> 80% of LCA time is spent **finding, cleaning, and structuring data** — not analyzing it.

That’s where **AI is not only appropriate but essential**.\
Unlike in creative or subjective fields, in LCA the AI’s job is _not to invent_ — but to _organize, match, and optimize verified data_.

---

### How AI Powers LCA the Right Way

AI’s ability to process complex, structured datasets makes it _perfectly aligned_ with the scientific rigor of LCA.\
Here’s how Sustainly uses AI to turn complexity into clarity:

| Function                   | Traditional Challenge                      | AI Advantage with Sustainly                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Data Sourcing**       | Manual searches across multiple databases. | AI automates data discovery and maps inputs to **verified EF and ecoinvent datasets**. |
| 🧩 **Model Building**      | High risk of human inconsistency.          | AI constructs system models based on **standardized methods** (EF 3.1, ReCiPe 2016).   |
| 📈 **Scenario Comparison** | Time-intensive recalculations.             | AI recalculates impacts instantly across **thousands of product variants**.            |
| 🧾 **Compliance Checks**   | Manual interpretation of EN 15804 rules.   | Sustainly encodes compliance frameworks directly into the AI workflow.                 |
| 🔗 **Integration**         | Data locked in silos (ERP, PLM).           | Sustainly’s AI connects **existing enterprise systems** automatically.                 |

<Info>
  AI in LCA is not about prediction — it’s about precision.
</Info>

---

### Why AI Misuse Happens — and Why LCA Avoids It

Most AI misuse stems from three common issues:

1. **Lack of Ground Truth** — AI trained on unverified or biased data produces unreliable results.
2. **Subjectivity in Evaluation** — In marketing or HR, there’s no single “right answer.”
3. **No Clear Framework for Validation** — AI decisions are hard to audit.

In contrast, **LCA operates within clear, measurable, and verifiable boundaries**.\
Every dataset has a reference, every impact a unit, and every result a standard (e.g., ISO 14044, EN 15804, or PEF).

That’s why AI shines here:

> It thrives in structured environments where transparency and consistency are _required by design_.

Sustainly leverages this strength — not to replace expert judgment, but to handle the _data-heavy foundations_ of credible LCAs.

---

## AI-Powered LCA: From Spreadsheets To Automated Insights

Most LCAs still start in spreadsheets. AI changes that by automating data mapping, harmonizing units, suggesting background datasets, and producing clean comparisons in minutes. For students and SMEs, this means less time wrestling with data and more time interpreting results.

**Why Sustainly?** AI-assisted mapping, model Q&A, scenario cloning, EN 15804 workflows, and integrations with PLM/ERP turn manual steps into a guided flow.

### What AI Actually Does In LCA

- **Smart data mapping:** connects supplier columns to standard flows and units.
- **Process suggestions:** recommends background datasets by region/technology.
- **Consistency checks:** flags odd numbers, unit conflicts, or missing stages.
- **Scenario generation:** clones models and edits key levers (recycled content, transport, suppliers).
- **Model Q&A:** ask the model “what drives 80% of climate impact?” and get a traceable answer.

### Practical Workflow (Student/SME)

1. Import BOM/supplier CSV → AI maps columns and units.
2. Pick methods (IPCC 2021 + EF 3.1).
3. Auto-generate 2–4 scenarios.
4. Run LCIA → get hotspot and contribution charts.
5. Export charts/CSV or EN 15804 package.

### What Stays Human

Goal/scope choices, functional unit, interpretation, and policy/business context. AI speeds the middle, not the purpose of the study.

### Common Pitfalls

- Blind acceptance of suggestions → always scan dataset region/tech.
- Only climate results → include multi-category EF 3.1 view.
- No uncertainty notes → keep a short, structured assumptions block.

### FAQ

**Is AI required to run LCA?** No, but it cuts time-to-insight drastically.\
**Will AI choose the wrong dataset?** Check region/tech; adjust as needed.\
**Can I still export an EPD package?** Yes—use EN 15804 workflow.

### Why Use Sustainly

## AI for Taxonomy and Unit Harmonization in LCA: Clean Messy Data in Minutes

Messy spreadsheets kill LCA quality: “SS 18/8”, “stainless304”, and “steel austenitic” might be the same thing; kWh and MJ get mixed; distances arrive in miles. AI can standardize names, map to the right background datasets, and fix units in one pass—so you can focus on interpretation.

### What To Standardize

- **Taxonomy:** material/process names → canonical terms (e.g., “stainless steel 18/8”).
- **Units:** g→kg, miles→km, BTU→MJ, L→m³.
- **Metadata:** region, year, technology qualifiers.
- **Sources:** primary vs. secondary, reported vs. inferred.

### 5-Step Harmonization Flow

1. **Collect datasets** (BOM, utilities, transports, packaging).
2. **Detect conflicts** (duplicate names, mixed units, missing region).
3. **Suggest canonical terms** (AI proposes; you approve).
4. **Map to background datasets** with region/tech fit notes.
5. **Lock a dictionary** (golden mapping) and reapply on every import.

**In Sustainly:** Importer profiles + AI-assisted mapping; unit harmonization runs automatically; you review exceptions.

### Canonical Dictionary (Starter)

- `stainless 18/8` → `Stainless steel, austenitic 18/8 (EU, 2024)`
- `cardboard` → `Paperboard, recycled content 80% (EU)`
- `truck med` → `Transport, freight, 16–32 t, EURO6 (EU)`

Keep this file versioned (JSON/YAML) and reuse across projects.

### Validation Checks To Enable

- **Unit guardrails:** reject unknown strings; require base SI.
- **Range checks:** kWh/unit within 0.1–20 for process X.
- **Region gates:** EU-only datasets unless override.
- **Completeness:** no empty A-modules when EN 15804 is on.

### Handling Edge Cases

- **No exact dataset match:** choose nearest tech + add uncertainty note.
- **Mixed-year data:** normalize to study year or flag sensitivity.
- **Supplier synonyms:** add alias list so future imports auto-map.

### Audit & Traceability

- Save the **mapping report** (old → new, reason, reviewer).
- Store **unit conversions** (factor, source).
- Keep **exceptions log** for verifier review.

### FAQ

**Will AI ever map wrong?** It can—review region/technology before approving.\
**Do I need ecoinvent?** Start with EU PEF; add ecoinvent if coverage requires.\
**How do I keep it updated?** Version the dictionary; review quarterly.

### Why Use Sustainly

AI mapping that learns your taxonomy, automatic unit harmonization, saved profiles per supplier, EF 3.1/IPCC/ReCiPe coverage, and EN 15804-ready exports with verifier access.
