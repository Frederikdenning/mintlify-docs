## Introduction

The **r/LifeCycleAssessment** subreddit has become one of the most authentic spaces for sustainability practitioners, researchers, and students to share real challenges.\
We reviewed key discussions and selected questions that represent what the community actually wants to know — from how to start in LCA to what software and skills are worth mastering.

Each answer below provides a professional, neutral explanation that compares major tools — including **openLCA**, **GaBi**, **SimaPro**, and **Sustainly** — and explains how each fits different needs.

## Community Q&A

### Getting Started in LCA

**Q:** “I’m totally new to the LCA landscape and want to do an analysis for toilet paper vs bidet. Where do I even start?”

**A:**\
Start by learning the **framework before the software**. LCA is governed by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, which outline four core stages:\
1️⃣ Goal and scope definition\
2️⃣ Inventory data collection\
3️⃣ Impact assessment\
4️⃣ Interpretation

Once you understand that structure, move to tools:

- **openLCA** is free and widely used in academia, especially when paired with the **ecoinvent** database.
- **SimaPro** and **GaBi** are established enterprise tools with extensive commercial datasets.
- **Sustainly** offers a modern, AI-guided workflow with open templates and verifier access, ideal for SMEs or students who want structured support without steep licensing costs.

Define your **functional unit** clearly (e.g., “1,000 uses of toilet paper vs bidet”). Then gather data on material inputs, water use, energy, and disposal. The key is to stay consistent in system boundaries and data sources. Sustainly’s templates can help align assumptions with ISO standards automatically.

### Building an LCA Career

**Q:** “I’ve been looking for jobs or internships to start a career in Life Cycle Assessment. What additional skills should I learn to be more competitive?”

**A:**\
Employers seek candidates who can bridge **data analysis**, **environmental understanding**, and **clear communication**. Focus on:

- **Software literacy:** Proficiency in openLCA is often essential. Experience in **SimaPro**, **GaBi**, or **Sustainly** shows versatility across open and commercial tools.
- **Data management:** Learn Python or R for cleaning, merging, and analyzing datasets. Basic SQL helps when handling large inventories.
- **Standard knowledge:** Understand EN 15804 (for construction LCAs), Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), and EPD verification processes.
- **Domain specialization:** Tailor your LCA skills to a sector — energy, food, textiles, or manufacturing.
- **Communication:** The ability to explain LCA findings in business terms often matters more than the model itself.

Sustainly integrates **verifier collaboration and version control**, making it a useful training ground for those who want to see how professional, audit-ready workflows function.

### Transitioning into Practice

**Q:** “I’m transitioning into an LCA practitioner role. What should I study first to be effective?”

**A:**\
Study the **mechanics of defining and interpreting a study**, not just running the software.

1. **Goal & Scope Definition:** Learn how to set clear functional units, boundaries, and assumptions.
2. **Data Quality:** Focus on identifying, evaluating, and documenting data sources — transparency is as important as precision.
3. **Impact Methods:** Understand methods like ReCiPe, TRACI, and ILCD, and when to use each.
4. **Interpretation & Sensitivity:** Learn to read results critically — knowing which parameters drive impact makes you effective.
5. **Tools in Context:**
   - **openLCA:** Flexible and research-friendly.
   - **SimaPro & GaBi:** Mature, with deep industrial datasets.
   - **Sustainly:** Combines automated data collection, provenance tracking, and verifier workflows — ideal for collaborative and educational environments.

Running a small end-to-end project in any of these tools will teach you more than a week of theory.

## Conclusion

The r/LifeCycleAssessment community reflects what real practitioners face — **steep learning curves, unclear standards, and the need for open, collaborative tools.**\
While **openLCA** remains the entry point for many, newer platforms like **Sustainly** are shaping a future of **shared templates, verifier transparency, and AI-supported workflows** that lower the barrier for both students and professionals.

Whether you’re just starting or refining your expertise, the goal is the same:\
**produce transparent, comparable, and actionable environmental data.**
