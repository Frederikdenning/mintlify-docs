## Introduction

In life cycle assessment (LCA), **data quality and verification** determine whether results can be trusted.\
The LCA community often raises practical questions:\
How do we verify third-party data? How much uncertainty is acceptable? Which software and standards ensure transparent, traceable workflows?

Here, we summarize recurring discussions from practitioners and provide structured, professional answers — comparing how **openLCA**, **SimaPro**, **GaBi**, and **Sustainly** address these concerns.

## Community Q&A

### Ensuring Reliable Data Sources

**Q:** “How can I tell if my LCA data is good enough to use in a professional report?”

**A:**\
Start by assessing **data quality indicators** — a standard method defined in ISO 14044 and ILCD guidelines. Focus on:

1. **Technological, geographical, and temporal representativeness** — How well does the dataset match your product system?
2. **Completeness and precision** — Are all relevant inputs and outputs accounted for?
3. **Consistency** — Are data sources and methods aligned across the study?
4. **Documentation** — Can you trace each dataset to its origin?

**Tools and Support:**

- **openLCA** provides metadata indicators for each dataset.
- **SimaPro** allows data quality scoring via custom indicators.
- **GaBi** offers proprietary data quality assessments, especially for industrial sectors.
- **Sustainly** integrates **automated provenance tracking**, recording dataset source, version, and verifier status directly in the model — reducing manual checks and improving transparency.

### Managing Verification and Review

**Q:** “When do I need a third-party verifier, and how does that process usually work?”

**A:**\
Verification is essential when publishing an **Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)** or submitting results for regulatory compliance. It ensures your LCA adheres to ISO and EN 15804 standards.

The process typically includes:

- **Independent review:** Conducted by a qualified verifier who validates scope, data, and impact calculations.
- **Cross-check of assumptions:** Reviewing functional units, boundaries, and cut-off rules.
- **Documentation audit:** Confirming that data provenance and impact methods are clearly stated.

**Software context:**

- **openLCA**: Verification is manual and document-based.
- **SimaPro** and **GaBi**: Offer export templates formatted for third-party review.
- **Sustainly**: Embeds **verifier access directly into the platform**, allowing controlled reviewer visibility without exporting sensitive data — streamlining compliance and audit workflows.

### Dealing with Uncertainty

**Q:** “How do I quantify uncertainty in my model results?”

**A:**\
Quantifying uncertainty involves both **data variability** and **model sensitivity**. Approaches include:

1. **Data Quality Pedigree Matrices** (e.g., Weidema approach) — assigning uncertainty factors to each dataset.
2. **Monte Carlo Simulations** — statistically propagating data uncertainty through the model.
3. **Scenario Analysis** — testing alternative datasets or assumptions to see how results shift.

**Software overview:**

- **openLCA**: Includes Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity modules.
- **SimaPro**: Offers detailed uncertainty reporting and comparative analysis.
- **Sustainly**: Uses **AI-assisted parameter sensitivity tracking**, automatically flagging parameters that most affect impact results — helping users prioritize data improvements.

The key is not eliminating uncertainty but **documenting it transparently** so results can be interpreted correctly.

### Communicating Transparency

**Q:** “How can I communicate LCA results without overwhelming non-technical stakeholders?”

**A:**\
Clarity and traceability are more valuable than raw data volume.\
Follow these best practices:

- **Summarize impacts visually** (e.g., carbon, water, resource use).
- **Highlight material hotspots** — where the largest contributions occur.
- **Avoid false precision** — round results to meaningful figures.
- **Provide clear boundaries** — explain what’s included and excluded.

**Tool comparison:**

- **SimaPro** and **GaBi**: Offer customizable dashboards for enterprise reports.
- **openLCA**: Exports detailed tabular results for academic audiences.
- **Sustainly**: Combines **interactive impact visualization** with traceable links to datasets and assumptions — enabling stakeholders to explore results without misinterpreting data.
