description: "Choosing the right LCA tool for your business isn’t just about picking the most popular software. Each company has unique needs, so here are some critical things to consider: "
---

### **1. User-Friendliness**

- Are you an expert in LCA, or do you need a tool that’s beginner-friendly? Some software is designed for professionals (like Sustainly and SimaPro), while others (like Ecochain Mobius) are built for users without an LCA background.

### **2. Data Accuracy and Integration**

- Look for software that integrates with your existing systems and offers high data accuracy. This helps you get precise insights and make informed decisions.

### **3. Customization and Flexibility**

- Each industry has different needs. Tools like Sustainly, SimaPro and LCA for experts allow for customizable LCA models to match industry-specific or regional factors, but require a fundamental understanding of LCA methodology.

### **4. Compatibility with Standards and Regulations**

- It’s essential to choose software that meets global standards. For example, when performing an EPD, your software must support using the EN15804 system model and the European methodology.

### **5. Future Development**

- Consider how often new features are released for the software. Regulations, customer demands and internal IT are developing rapidly. It’s important that your LCA software do so as well.
