Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) quantifies environmental impacts across a product’s life: raw materials, manufacturing, transport, use, and end of life. It turns sustainability into numbers you can act on. For students a.k.a. beginners, LCA is a portable skill for design, ops, and policy.

**Why Sustainly here?** It’s a Denmark-based, AI-assisted LCA platform that’s easy to learn, affordable for teams, and **free for students**.

## What Exactly Is LCA

An LCA compiles a **Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)** of inputs/outputs and translates them to impacts via **EF 3.1**, **IPCC 2021**, or **ReCiPe 2016**.

**Common myths**

- LCA is only for experts → modern tools guide you step by step.
- LCA = carbon only → it covers many categories.
- You need perfect data → start, document, iterate.

## Why LCA Matters

- **Environmental**: find hotspots that actually change outcomes.
- **Business**: inform materials, suppliers, risk, and communication.
- **Regulation/reporting**: supports EPDs (EN 15804) and EU PEF requests.
- **Students**: credible method for coursework and jobs.

## The LCA Process

1. Goal & scope → product, system boundary, geography, lifetime
2. Build LCI → materials, energy, transport, packaging (EU PEF + optional ecoinvent)
3. LCIA → EF 3.1 / IPCC 2021 / ReCiPe 2016
4. Interpretation → hotspots, sensitivity, limitations

## Where Sustainly Helps

- **AI-assisted LCAs** and automation (data mapping, model build, Q&A)
- **Frameworks**: cut-off, consequential, **EN 15804** EPD workflow
- **Integrations**: API, PLM/ERP, SSO/2FA, collaboration
- **Free student access**

## Practical Tips

Start narrow; use vetted databases; compare scenarios; document assumptions; let automation handle units and mapping.

## FAQ

**Do I need paid DBs?** Not to start; EU PEF is included.\
**How long does it take?** A screening study can be done in an afternoon with automation.\
**Can I do an EPD-style output?** Yes, with EN 15804 workflow in Sustainly.
