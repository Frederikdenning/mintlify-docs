In Life Cycle Assessment, data is king — but not all data is created equal.\
Understanding the difference between **foreground** and **background** data will help you model faster, smarter, and with more credibility.

---

## What Is Foreground Data?

Data from **your direct operations** — what you control or can directly measure.

📍 Examples:

- Your factory’s energy use
- Product weight or BOM
- Scrap rates in assembly
- Transport distances from your warehouse
- Supplier-specific emissions (if collected)

---

## What Is Background Data?

Data from **generic or external sources**, usually pulled from LCA databases like:

- Ecoinvent
- GaBi
- ELCD
- Agri-footprint
- PlasticsEurope

📍 Examples:

- Average electricity mix in Spain
- Global data on steel production
- Emissions from upstream petrochemical refining

## Why This Distinction Matters

| Factor       | Foreground             | Background                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Accuracy     | High (specific to you) | Medium (industry average) |
| Control      | You can influence      | You can't change          |
| Transparency | Easy to audit          | Often opaque              |
| Use in EPDs  | Required               | Allowed with disclosure   |

## Tips for Getting Foreground Data

✅ Start with materials, energy, and transport\
✅ Talk to procurement or factory managers\
✅ Ask suppliers for simple input tables\
✅ Record source, date, and assumptions\
✅ Use Sustainly’s AI to flag unit mismatches or missing values

## How Much Background Data Is OK?

It depends on your goal:

- For internal screening → background is OK
- For EPDs or marketing claims → foreground preferred
- For EU compliance (EF 3.1) → mixed, but with clear disclosure

📌 _Pro tip_: Always state your **data sources and vintage** in your report.

## Final Takeaway

Don’t overthink it — just be clear.\
Use foreground data where you can, and background data where you must.
