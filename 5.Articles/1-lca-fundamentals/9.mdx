Some products donâ€™t just produce one thing. Think **dairy cows (milk + meat)** or **refineries (fuel + chemicals)**.

So how do you assign environmental impacts between them?

One option is **system expansion** â€” a powerful but often misunderstood tool in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

This guide breaks it down in plain language, with examples and when to use it.

## What Is System Expansion?

System expansion is a method used in LCA to **avoid allocation** by expanding the system boundaries to include the **functions of co-products**.

Instead of splitting impacts between products, you **model what the other product replaces** in the market â€” and subtract that from the total impact.

## Real-Life Example: Biogas from Food Waste

Letâ€™s say your system creates:

- 1 ton of compost  
- 200 kWh of electricity (biogas)

Instead of dividing impacts, you include:

- The avoided impact of making 200 kWh from coal  
- The avoided impact of producing synthetic fertilizer

ðŸ“Œ Result: The system gets **credited** for displacing these more harmful alternatives.

## Allocation vs. System Expansion

| Feature | Allocation | System Expansion |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| What it does | Splits impacts between outputs | Expands system to include alternatives |
| Data needed | Output ratios (mass, energy, economic) | Impact of displaced product/process |
| Pros | Simpler, widely accepted | Reflects full market effect |
| Cons | Can feel arbitrary | Requires more data, assumptions |

---

## When Should You Use System Expansion?

âœ… When outputs are **functionally different**  
âœ… When allocation would distort results  
âœ… In **consequential LCA** (market-based approach)  
âœ… When comparing **circular vs linear systems**

ðŸ“Œ Often used in: bio-based materials, recycling systems, waste treatment, multi-output chemical plants

---

## Key Considerations

- Define **what your co-product replaces** (regional & realistic)  
- Use **up-to-date substitution data** (e.g. electricity mix, fertilizer type)  
- Be transparent â€” document assumptions clearly  
- Sensitivity analysis is a must (small changes = big effect)

## Tools That Support System Expansion

âœ… OpenLCA (consequential mode)  
âœ… SimaPro (with market links)  
âœ… Sustainly (scenario modeling engine)  
âœ… Brightway2 (full flexibility)

## Final Takeaway

System expansion gives you a smarter way to model multi-output systems â€” **if** you use it transparently.

Itâ€™s more work, but often gives a **truer picture of real-world impacts**.
