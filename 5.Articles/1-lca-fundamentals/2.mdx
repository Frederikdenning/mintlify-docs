Starting with LCA can be tricky. Most errors are easy to fix once you know them. Here are the top 10 and quick remedies, plus where **Sustainly** prevents them.

## 1) Vague Functional Unit

**Fix:** write one precise FU and lock it before data collection.\
**Sustainly:** setup wizard stores FU across scenarios.

## 2) Unclear Boundaries

**Fix:** choose cradle-to-gate or cradle-to-grave and list inclusions/exclusions.\
**Sustainly:** boundary selection visible in model view.

## 3) Mixed Data Without Sources

**Fix:** tag each input with source/date; note blends.\
**Sustainly:** attach sources per flow; AI notes.

## 4) Wrong Background Process

**Fix:** match region/tech/year.\
**Sustainly:** smart filters + suggestions from EU PEF / ecoinvent.

## 5) Unit Errors

**Fix:** standardize to SI; run sanity checks.\
**Sustainly:** auto unit harmonization + warnings.

## 6) Allocation Confusion

**Fix:** select cut-off, consequential, or EN 15804 and stay consistent.\
**Sustainly:** project-level allocation setting.

## 7) Carbon-Only Reporting

**Fix:** include multi-category view (EF 3.1) alongside climate.\
**Sustainly:** one-click method switch and compare.

## 8) No Scenario Analysis

**Fix:** model 2–4 realistic levers.\
**Sustainly:** clone/label scenarios in minutes.

## 9) Weak Interpretation

**Fix:** highlight 1–2 hotspots, propose one change, add uncertainty notes.\
**Sustainly:** hotspot charts + notes panel.

## 10) Skipping EPD Structure

**Fix:** use EN 15804 modules when EPD-style comms are needed.\
**Sustainly:** EN 15804 workflow with exports + verifier access.

## Quick Validation Checklist

FU fixed • Boundaries clear • Sources tagged • Right datasets • Units consistent • Allocation set • Multi-category • Scenarios present • Interpretation strong • EPD structure when relevant.

## FAQ

**Screening OK for class?** Yes—be transparent.\
**Start DB?** EU PEF; add ecoinvent as needed.\
