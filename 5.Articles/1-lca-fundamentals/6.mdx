Choosing the right **system boundary** is a key decision in any Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It defines _which stages of a product’s life_ are included in your analysis — and which are not.

The three most common options are:

- **Cradle-to-Gate**
- **Cradle-to-Grave**
- **Cradle-to-Cradle**

Each serves a different purpose. This article breaks them down — with examples — so you can choose the right one for your study or EPD.

## What Are System Boundaries?

In LCA, system boundaries define the **start and end points** of the product system being analyzed.\
They determine which processes, life stages, and impacts are **included** or **excluded**.

Without clearly defined boundaries, your LCA may become:

- Misleading
- Incomplete
- Non-comparable with other studies

---

## 1. Cradle-to-Gate 🏗️

**What it includes**:

- Raw material extraction
- Transport to manufacturing
- Manufacturing process

**What it excludes**:

- Product use
- End-of-life (disposal, recycling, etc.)

**Use this when**:

- You don’t control the use or disposal phase
- You’re comparing manufacturing footprints
- You’re doing a **supplier-facing** or **B2B** LCA
- For early-stage eco-design or material analysis

📌 _Example_: Calculating the carbon footprint of aluminum production up to the factory gate.

---

## 2. Cradle-to-Grave ⚰️

**What it includes**:

- Raw materials
- Manufacturing
- Distribution
- Use phase
- End-of-life treatment

**Use this when**:

- You want the **full environmental picture**
- You're creating an EPD for **consumer goods**
- You need to assess **lifetime impacts** (e.g., packaging, apparel, electronics)

📌 _Example_: Assessing the total footprint of a cotton T-shirt including washing, drying, and disposal.

---

## 3. Cradle-to-Cradle ♻️

**What it includes**:\
Same as cradle-to-grave **plus** recycling or reuse as **input into new life cycles**

**Use this when**:

- You're designing for circularity
- You want to show **material recovery benefits**
- You apply **closed-loop recycling** in your system

📌 _Example_: A modular phone designed for full disassembly and material reuse.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Boundary Type    | Use Phase Included? | End-of-Life Included? | Circularity Modeled? |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cradle-to-Gate   | ❌ No                | ❌ No                  | ❌ No                 |
| Cradle-to-Grave  | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                 |
| Cradle-to-Cradle | ✅ Yes               | ♻️ Reuse/Recycling    | ✅ Yes                |

## How to Choose the Right Boundary

Ask these questions:

✅ Who is the **audience**? (customers, designers, suppliers?)\
✅ Do you know how the product is **used and disposed**?\
✅ Are you comparing **materials** or **complete systems**?\
✅ Do you want to model **circularity**?

> Tip: Always state your system boundary in your report and explain what’s excluded and why.

---

## Boundary in EPDs and EU Regulations

- **EN 15804** and most **construction EPDs** use **cradle-to-gate with options**
- **EF 3.1** (Product Environmental Footprint) typically requires **cradle-to-grave**
- Always check the **PCR** (Product Category Rules) for your product category

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ Using cradle-to-gate and then making product-level sustainability claims\
❌ Omitting end-of-life just because data is missing\
❌ Not stating the boundary in your LCA documentation\
❌ Mixing boundaries when comparing two products

---

## Final Takeaway

Your system boundary determines what your LCA does — and doesn’t — say.\
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but there _is_ a right fit for your purpose.
