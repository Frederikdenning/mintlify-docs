**Primary data** makes your LCA more accurate, credible, and decision-ready.  
But collecting it can feel like herding cats — across suppliers, factories, and spreadsheets.

Here’s your how-to guide to get the data you need without frustration — especially for your **first LCA study**.

## Why Primary Data Matters

- 🌱 More accurate than database averages  
- ✅ Required for EPDs and customer-facing reports  
- 🔍 Helps identify real hotspots in your own processes  
- 🏆 Adds credibility to sustainability claims

## Who to Ask (and What to Ask For)

| Source | What to Request |
|--------|-----------------|
| Internal factory | Material input/output, energy, water, waste |
| Supplier | Transport modes, packaging, recycled content |
| Logistics | Shipping distances, load factors, return trips |
| Assembly partners | Assembly energy, scrap rates, equipment type |

---

## 🛠️ Sample Data Table (for Suppliers)

| Parameter | Value | Unit | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|
| Material input | 1,250 | kg | Polymer resin |
| Electricity | 1,900 | kWh | Annual total |
| Transport | 700 | km | From plant to warehouse |
| Scrap rate | 8 | % | For injection molding |

📌 *Pro tip*: Use consistent units (e.g. kg, kWh) and document the **year** and **source** for each entry.

## 5 Golden Rules of Primary Data Collection

1. **Start simple** — focus on top materials, energy, and transport  
2. **Avoid perfectionism** — better to be roughly right than precisely missing  
3. **Always include source & year** — no “anonymous Excel tabs”  
4. **Ask for ranges, not just point values** (e.g. low/avg/high)  
5. **Keep a clean audit trail** — version control is your friend

## Tools That Make It Easier

✅ Google Forms (quick collection from multiple suppliers)  
✅ Sustainly (AI helps fill gaps + flags missing units)  
✅ Excel with dropdowns for units and sources  
✅ SharePoint or Notion for centralized logs

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Sending 20-tab Excel monsters  
❌ Asking for data your supplier doesn’t have  
❌ Mixing data from different years without noting it  
❌ Forgetting unit conversions (m³ vs liters, MJ vs kWh)  
❌ Not following up — most suppliers won’t reply the first time

## Final Tip

The first LCA is always the hardest. The second is much easier — *if* you keep your data structure clean from day one.
