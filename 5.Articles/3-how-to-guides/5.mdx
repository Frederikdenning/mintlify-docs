You’ve completed your Life Cycle Assessment — now what? Communicating your results effectively is just as important as conducting the LCA itself.

## Why Communication Matters

LCA results are often filled with data, charts, and technical language. But for decision-makers, stakeholders, and the public, clarity is key. The ability to **translate complex data into actionable insight** determines whether your work drives real impact.

## Strategies for Clear Communication

1. **Simplify without oversimplifying** – Focus on key findings and their implications.  
2. **Use relatable metrics** – Express results in understandable terms like “CO₂ equivalent per product.”  
3. **Visualize impacts** – Use Sankey diagrams, bar charts, or icons to show hotspots and improvements.  
4. **Tell a story** – Frame the findings around a problem-solution narrative.  
5. **Adapt to your audience** – Executives need business relevance; consumers need emotional connection.

## Tools and Formats

- **Dashboards** (Power BI, Sustainly LCA Dashboard) for interactive visualization  
- **Infographics** for quick summaries  
- **Reports and presentations** following ISO 14040/44 reporting standards
