Doing an LCA is one thing. Turning it into a **verified EPD** (Environmental Product Declaration) is what gives your results legal and market value.

Here’s how to go from impact results to a **published, recognized EPD** — step by step.

---

## What Is an EPD?

An Environmental Product Declaration is a standardized, third-party verified document that:

- Communicates your product’s environmental impact  
- Follows a defined Product Category Rule (PCR)  
- Is usually published in a national or international program (e.g. EPD Norge, ECO Platform)

📌 Often required in **construction**, **packaging**, and **procurement** tenders.

---

## Step 1: Finalize a Compliant LCA

- Use a software tool that follows **ISO 14040/44** and **EN 15804** (for construction)  
- Model all required life cycle stages (A1–A3 minimum)  
- Include all impact categories defined in the PCR  
- Ensure data quality and sources are clearly documented

## Step 2: Identify the Right PCR

The PCR defines **how your product should be modeled**.

Find it via:

- [ECO Platform](https://www.eco-platform.org/pcrs.html)  
- [Environdec](https://environdec.com/pcr)  
- Industry-specific EPD program websites

📌 *Tip*: Some sectors allow “PCR Part B” for extra specificity (e.g. windows, insulation, piping)

---

## Step 3: Review & Prepare Documentation

Prepare your:

- LCA report (method, system boundaries, results)  
- EPD draft (formatted to PCR rules)  
- Declaration tables  
- Interpretation summary  
- Data disclosure and cut-offs

---

## Step 4: Third-Party Verification

An independent LCA expert will:

- Check your model and inputs  
- Ensure alignment with the PCR  
- Review calculation methods and assumptions  
- Sign off the final EPD

📌 Some programs require pre-approved verifiers. Check before you begin!

---

## Step 5: Publish the EPD

Submit to an official program:

- **Environdec**  
- **EPD Norge**  
- **IBU** (Germany)  
- **The International EPD System**  
- **ECO Platform** (EU umbrella)

Your EPD is then:

- Publicly listed  
- Assigned a unique ID  
- Valid for 5 years (typically)

---

## Timeline & Cost Overview

| Step | Time Estimate |
|------|---------------|
| Final LCA | 2–4 weeks |
| PCR matching | 1 week |
| EPD draft | 1 week |
| Verification | 2–3 weeks |
| Publishing | 1–2 weeks |

💰 *Typical cost*: €3,000–€10,000 (varies by product & verifier)

---

## Final Takeaway

A verified EPD turns your LCA into **market-ready proof**. It unlocks access to tenders, certifications (LEED, BREEAM), and helps build trust with customers.
