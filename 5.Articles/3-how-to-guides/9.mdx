You ran the LCA. You have the data. But what now?

**Communicating Life Cycle Assessment results** clearly is one of the most overlooked — and most powerful — steps in making sustainability actionable.

This guide helps you tailor your message for different audiences and turn dry numbers into decisions.

## 1. Know Your Audience

| Audience | What They Care About |
|----------|----------------------|
| Designers | Hotspots, trade-offs, material swaps |
| Procurement | Supplier-level data, cost/impact balance |
| Executives | KPIs, compliance risk, trends |
| Customers | Proof of claims, simple visuals |
| Marketing | Approved claims, visuals, "green" messaging |

## 2. Simplify, Don’t Dumb Down

- Use **relative impact bars** (e.g. 50% of impact = packaging)  
- Avoid raw units without context (what is 0.3 kg CO₂e?)  
- Use **analogies** ("this equals driving 1.2 km")  
- Show **hotspot diagrams** (not tables with 17 digits)

---

## 3. Good Practices by Format

✅ **One-pager PDF** with summary stats  
✅ **Slide for design reviews** showing best vs baseline  
✅ **Dashboards** for portfolio comparisons  
✅ **Footprint label** for customer-facing materials  
✅ **Infographics or carousels** for LinkedIn or Instagram

---

## 4. Claims to Avoid

❌ "Carbon neutral" (unless certified offset path exists)  
❌ "100% sustainable" (too vague)  
❌ "No impact" (misleading)  
✅ Better: “30% lower footprint compared to our 2022 model”
