<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User-Friendliness">
    Are you an expert in LCA, or do you need a tool that’s beginner-friendly?<br/>
    Some software is designed for professionals (like Sustainly and SimaPro),
    while others (like Ecochain Mobius) are built for users without an LCA background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Accuracy and Integration">
    Look for software that integrates with your existing systems and offers high data accuracy.<br/>
    This helps you get precise insights and make informed decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customization and Flexibility">
    Each industry has different needs. Tools like Sustainly, SimaPro and LCA for experts
    allow for customizable LCA models to match industry-specific or regional factors,
    but require a fundamental understanding of LCA methodology.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compatibility with Standards and Regulations">
    It’s essential to choose software that meets global standards.<br/>
    For example, when performing an EPD, your software must support
    using the EN15804 system model and the European methodology.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Future Development">
    Consider how often new features are released for the software.<br/>
    Regulations, customer demands and internal IT are developing rapidly.
    It’s important that your LCA software do so as well.
