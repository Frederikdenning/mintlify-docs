Messy spreadsheets kill LCA quality: “SS 18/8”, “stainless304”, and “steel austenitic” might be the same thing; kWh and MJ get mixed; distances arrive in miles. AI can standardize names, map to the right background datasets, and fix units in one pass—so you can focus on interpretation.

## What To Standardize
- **Taxonomy:** material/process names → canonical terms (e.g., “stainless steel 18/8”).  
- **Units:** g→kg, miles→km, BTU→MJ, L→m³.  
- **Metadata:** region, year, technology qualifiers.  
- **Sources:** primary vs. secondary, reported vs. inferred.

## 5-Step Harmonization Flow
1) **Collect datasets** (BOM, utilities, transports, packaging).  
2) **Detect conflicts** (duplicate names, mixed units, missing region).  
3) **Suggest canonical terms** (AI proposes; you approve).  
4) **Map to background datasets** with region/tech fit notes.  
5) **Lock a dictionary** (golden mapping) and reapply on every import.

**In Sustainly:** Importer profiles + AI-assisted mapping; unit harmonization runs automatically; you review exceptions.

## Canonical Dictionary (Starter)
- `stainless 18/8` → `Stainless steel, austenitic 18/8 (EU, 2024)`  
- `cardboard` → `Paperboard, recycled content 80% (EU)`  
- `truck med` → `Transport, freight, 16–32 t, EURO6 (EU)`

Keep this file versioned (JSON/YAML) and reuse across projects.

## Validation Checks To Enable
- **Unit guardrails:** reject unknown strings; require base SI.  
- **Range checks:** kWh/unit within 0.1–20 for process X.  
- **Region gates:** EU-only datasets unless override.  
- **Completeness:** no empty A-modules when EN 15804 is on.

## Handling Edge Cases
- **No exact dataset match:** choose nearest tech + add uncertainty note.  
- **Mixed-year data:** normalize to study year or flag sensitivity.  
- **Supplier synonyms:** add alias list so future imports auto-map.

## Audit & Traceability
- Save the **mapping report** (old → new, reason, reviewer).  
- Store **unit conversions** (factor, source).  
- Keep **exceptions log** for verifier review.

## FAQ
**Will AI ever map wrong?** It can—review region/technology before approving.  
**Do I need ecoinvent?** Start with EU PEF; add ecoinvent if coverage requires.  
**How do I keep it updated?** Version the dictionary; review quarterly.

## Why Use Sustainly
AI mapping that learns your taxonomy, automatic unit harmonization, saved profiles per supplier, EF 3.1/IPCC/ReCiPe coverage, and EN 15804-ready exports with verifier access.
