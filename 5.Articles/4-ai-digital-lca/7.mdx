Life Cycle Assessment used to take weeks. Now, thanks to AI, you can get results in hours — without being a data scientist or sustainability expert.

But what does **AI-powered LCA** actually mean? And how does it work under the hood?

This article explains how artificial intelligence is changing the game in LCA — from **data collection** to **decision-making**.

## What Makes an LCA Tool “AI-Powered”?

AI in LCA doesn’t mean robots doing your homework — it means **smart automation** of repetitive, technical tasks like:

✅ Auto-filling material and transport inputs\
✅ Matching supplier data with emission factors\
✅ Suggesting typical values for missing inputs\
✅ Running background modeling based on industry data\
✅ Flagging unit errors or inconsistencies\
✅ Ranking improvement options based on hotspot results

## 5 Key AI Features to Look For

| Feature                         | What It Does                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📥 Smart data ingestion         | Imports and structures product data (BOMs, transport, energy) automatically |
| 🧠 Predictive input suggestions | Fills missing values based on previous models and market data               |
| 🔍 AI error detection           | Flags issues like unit mismatches or illogical values                       |
| 📊 Instant hotspot analysis     | Identifies the highest impact areas within seconds                          |
| ✍️ Report generation            | Creates LCA reports or one-pagers based on the model and metadata           |

## Real Use Cases

- **Product designers** model packaging with 80% fewer clicks
- **Procurement teams** auto-score suppliers on carbon intensity
- **LCA newcomers** complete baseline studies without formal training
- **Sales teams** generate EPD-style PDFs to send to clients

## What AI Can’t (Yet) Do

🚫 Replace expert judgment\
🚫 Understand business-specific context perfectly\
🚫 Guarantee compliance with every EPD standard — human verification still required

---

## Tools That Use AI in LCA

- **Sustainly** — AI-first platform for EU-aligned LCA
- **Ecochain Mobius** — AI-assisted material comparison
- **Siemens GaBi** — Automation for multi-product modeling
- **One Click LCA** — AI-driven templates for buildings
