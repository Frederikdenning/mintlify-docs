Digital twins — virtual replicas of real-world products, buildings, or systems — are changing how sustainability teams perform LCAs.  

By integrating real-time data from sensors, manufacturers can simulate the **entire life cycle** of a product before it’s even produced. This approach allows for **continuous LCA monitoring** and **impact forecasting** — a major step beyond static, one-off analyses.  

Key benefits include:  
- **Scenario modeling** for design alternatives.  
- **Real-time impact tracking** through IoT integration.  
- **AI-driven performance optimization** during the product’s life cycle.  

Digital twins make it possible to visualize not only how sustainable a product *is* but also how sustainable it *could be*. As industries move toward net-zero goals, this technology will play a defining role in achieving measurable environmental results.
