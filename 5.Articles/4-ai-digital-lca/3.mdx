AI gives best results when you ask clearly. These prompt templates help you map data, choose datasets, create scenarios, and write interpretations you can defend.

## Ground Rules
- Always include **functional unit**, **boundary**, **geography**, and **year**.  
- Ask for **assumptions** and **alternatives** explicitly.  
- Request **checks** (units, region/tech match, missing stages).

## Mapping Prompts (Copy-Ready)
- “Map these columns to LCA flows. FU: 1 unit. Boundary: cradle-to-gate. Region: EU. Flag any unit conflicts. Columns: [paste table].”
- “Suggest top 3 background datasets for ‘EU steel 18/8, 2024’; explain the region/tech fit.”

## Scenario Prompts
- “Clone baseline and create scenarios: (A) +70% recycled steel, (B) truck→train 200 km, (C) lifetime 5y. Tell me expected impact direction and why.”

## Interpretation Prompts
- “Summarize hotspots driving >80% climate impact; list 2 levers with estimated effect; add an uncertainty note (max 120 words).”

## QA/Consistency Prompts
- “Check if any stage is missing vs cradle-to-grave. Propose data sources for gaps.”  
- “Verify unit consistency (kg/km/kWh). Suggest fixes.”

## In Sustainly
Built-in model Q&A, AI-assisted mapping, and scenario cloning let you apply these prompts directly to your data and templates.

## FAQ
**Can prompts replace expert review?** No—use them to accelerate, then verify.  
**What if AI suggests a wrong dataset?** Check region/technology and adjust.  
**Can I store prompts?** Yes—save as project notes or runbooks.

## Why Use Sustainly
Reliable AI helpers inside the modeling flow + method coverage (EF 3.1/IPCC/ReCiPe) and EN 15804-ready exports.
