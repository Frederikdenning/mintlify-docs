## What & Why: LCA Software

### **What is LCA Software?**

LCA software is a tool that tracks a product’s environmental impact throughout its entire lifecycle—from raw materials and manufacturing to usage and disposal. By identifying areas of high resource use, pollution, or waste, businesses can make informed decisions to improve product sustainability.

### **Why is LCA Software Important?**

With the world moving toward sustainable practices, **LCA software** has become essential for companies aiming to understand and reduce the impact of their products. It doesn’t just highlight the environmental impact; it also supports eco-friendly product design, guides material selection, and meets regulatory demands for greener products. Additionally, more and more regulations and customers demand that companies perform LCAs in order to achieve certifications such as Environmental product declarations (EPDs), Product environmental footprint (PEFs) and to comply with various ISO standards.
