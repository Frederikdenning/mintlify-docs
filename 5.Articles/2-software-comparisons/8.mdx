If you're in construction or building product manufacturing, chances are someone has asked you for an EPD, a footprint, or a “green” version of your product.

Good news: there are tools built exactly for that.

Here’s our up-to-date list of **top LCA software platforms** tailored to **construction and building materials**.

## 🧱 Why Construction Needs Specialized LCA Tools

- Product Category Rules (PCRs) vary by material  
- EN 15804 standard compliance is often mandatory  
- Integration with BIM and CAD can save hours  
- EPD generation needs verified modules  
- Circularity and end-of-life modeling matters more in buildings
