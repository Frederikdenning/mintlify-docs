The Corporate LCA Playbook helps sustainability and product teams go from one-off studies to a scalable LCA capability. Whether your goal is compliance, design optimization, or responding to customer demands — this guide gives you the roadmap.

> Tip: Start small but design for scale — a pilot is your first test, not your final form.

## Who This Is For

- Sustainability managers
- Product and packaging teams
- Procurement and supplier engagement leads
- Strategy and ESG reporting units

## Four Building Blocks of a Corporate LCA Program

### 1. Purpose and Scope

Clarify what your LCA initiative is meant to do:

- Regulatory compliance (e.g., CSRD, EF 3.1)
- Eco-design and product development
- Customer transparency (EPDs, footprint requests)
- Internal goal tracking (Net Zero, circularity)

Define the **impact scope**: climate, water, resources, toxicity? Start with climate but plan for multi-impact later.

### 2. People and Governance

LCA touches many teams. Define:

- **Sponsors**: Budget holders and executives
- **Practitioners**: Internal LCA analysts or external consultants
- **Data Stewards**: Plant engineers, procurement, product developers
- **Reviewers**: For compliance or customer-facing results

Establish a working group with monthly check-ins and a central method guide.

### 3. Data and Methods

Standardize across teams:

- Functional unit templates
- Allocation rules (mass, economic, energy)
- System boundaries
- Secondary data preferences (e.g., Ecoinvent 3.9)
- Quality scores and update cadence

Create a shared data model: BOMs, energy, materials, transport, packaging, EOL assumptions.

### 4. Tools and Infrastructure

Pick tools that match your goals and internal capabilities:

- LCA modeling software (SimaPro, OpenLCA, One Click LCA…)
- Integrations with PLM or ERP systems
- Supplier data collection platforms or spreadsheets
- Dashboards for business units

Ensure auditability: version control, review trail, documentation.

## Launching Your First Pilot (0–90 Days)

| Phase | Milestones |
|-------|------------|
| **0–30 days** | Choose 3 pilot products. Write method guide. Create process maps. |
| **31–60 days** | Collect internal and supplier data. Run first LCIA. Identify hotspots. |
| **61–90 days** | Present results. Recommend design or sourcing actions. Lock pilot template. |

> Tip: Document all assumptions clearly — what you exclude today may matter tomorrow.

## Scaling to Portfolio Coverage

- Clone pilot templates across SKUs
- Group products by material/process similarity
- Train internal staff or hire capacity
- Use results in design reviews and sourcing RFQs
- Track KPI coverage (% revenue with LCA, supplier data coverage, GHG intensity/product)

## Integrating with Business Decisions

- **Design**: Show carbon reduction per design choice
- **Procurement**: Add carbon criteria in tenders
- **Marketing**: Standardized claims with caveats
- **Reporting**: Use verified footprints in CSRD, CDP, or ESG reports

## Common Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

- ❌ Doing everything manually → ✅ Use templates and auto-calculations
- ❌ Only looking at climate → ✅ Plan to cover 3–5 impact categories
- ❌ Ignoring suppliers → ✅ Engage top 20% by spend/impact early
- ❌ One-time study mindset → ✅ Build feedback loops with R&D and ops

## Final Thoughts

LCA is not just about emissions — it's a decision support tool. With the right setup, companies can make smarter, more sustainable product and supply chain decisions — and prove it.

Start with pilots, build processes, and grow into a portfolio-wide strategy.
