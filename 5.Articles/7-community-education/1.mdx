## How a DTU Course Sparked a Passion for LCAs
During a master’s in **Environmental Engineering at DTU**, the student enrolled in a course on **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**.\
What began as a theoretical exercise — calculating carbon footprints of everyday products — soon revealed a bigger picture: the power of data-driven sustainability.
> “At first, I thought LCAs were just about numbers. But the course showed me it’s about storytelling — connecting every stage of a product’s life to its real-world impact,” they recall.
Through hands-on projects, the class used tools like **openLCA** and **SimaPro** to build models. But they noticed something missing — accessibility.\
The software was powerful but **not intuitive**. Setting up even a simple LCA required hours of data wrangling and methodological setup.
That frustration sparked a question that would later define their career:
> _“Why can’t LCA be as easy as running a financial report?”_
