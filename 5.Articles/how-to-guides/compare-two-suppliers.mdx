This guide shows students, small businesses, and sustainability teams how to compare two suppliers using Life Cycle Assessment. You will define a fair scope, gather just enough data, build two comparable models, and present a clear recommendation. The workflow is simple and repeatable. Where helpful, we note how Sustainly accelerates each step with automation and templates.

## What You Will Deliver

- A fair and transparent scope for the comparison
- A minimal supplier data sheet that both vendors can fill
- Two modeled scenarios with identical functional units and boundaries
- A one-page chart that shows the winner and the main hotspot
- Notes on assumptions and a plan for data improvement

## Step 1. Define A Fair Scope

Write down the rules before you ask for data. Keep them the same for both suppliers.

**Scope checklist**

- Functional unit: one unit of the same product or service
- Boundary: cradle to gate or cradle to grave (choose once and keep it fixed)
- Geography and time: region and reporting year
- Allocation rules: cut-off or consequential, or EN 15804 if you need EPD structure
- Impact methods: IPCC 2021 for climate plus EF 3.1 for a wider view

**In Sustainly**: Create a project template with these settings so every scenario inherits the same boundaries and methods.

## Step 2. Ask For Only What You Need

Send a short data sheet to both suppliers. Focus on per-unit averages.

**Minimal fields**

- Process/product name and code
- Reporting year and site location
- Electricity per unit (kWh/unit)
- Fuels per unit (e.g., m³ gas/unit, liters diesel/unit)
- Main material inputs per unit and yields/scrap
- Transport in/out: distance (km) and mode
- Packaging, if supplier controls it

**Copy-ready email**

> Subject: Data request for supplier comparison\
> Hello [Name], we are comparing two suppliers for [component] using a simple environmental assessment. Please fill the attached sheet with typical **per-unit** values for your process at [site, year]. If a field isn’t tracked, leave it blank and add a note.\
> Deadline: [date]. Thank you — [Your name]

**In Sustainly**: Use the CSV importer and save a mapping profile so repeated uploads take seconds.

## Step 3. Validate Before You Import

**Sanity checks**

- Units consistent (kg, km, kWh/MJ)
- Values are per unit, not per batch
- Geography and year make sense
- Transport distances realistic for the route

**Comparability checks**

- Same bill of materials and packaging rules
- Same allocation rules for scrap/by-products
- Same use-phase and end-of-life if cradle to grave

**In Sustainly**: Unit harmonization converts to a common base and flags odd values.

## Step 4. Build Two Scenarios

Create one baseline model and clone it. Only swap the supplier-specific parts.

**Scenario setup**

- Scenario A: Supplier X data mapped to background processes
- Scenario B: Supplier Y data mapped to background processes
- Keep all other inputs identical

**In Sustainly**: Clone the model and change only the mapped supplier process or transport. Label scenarios clearly.

## Step 5. Run LCIA And Compare

Calculate impacts with your chosen methods.

**What to look for**

- Overall climate difference in percent
- Category trade-offs from EF 3.1 (e.g., water use vs. climate)
- Contribution analysis to see what drives the gap
- Sensitivity to transport or recycled content

**Deliverable**

- One bar chart with both suppliers side-by-side for climate
- One contribution chart showing the top hotspot for the higher result

**In Sustainly**: Use comparison view to export bars and contribution charts with one click.

## Step 6. Document Assumptions And Uncertainty

**Template note**

- Allocation: cut-off.
- Electricity: metered; fuel: bills divided by output.
- Material grade: proxy used where an exact dataset was unavailable.
- Transport: typical routes validated with logistics.
- Representativeness: 2024 production year.

**In Sustainly**: Add notes at project/process level so they travel with exports and verifier packages.

## Step 7. Make A Decision

State the recommendation in one or two sentences, then add clear next steps.

**Example**\
Supplier X has 18 percent lower climate impact and similar results across other EF 3.1 categories. The difference is driven by electricity intensity and scrap rate. We recommend Supplier X. Next: request quarterly data refreshes and confirm transport distances.

## Mini Case: Fast Packaging Supplier Comparison

A student team compared two box suppliers for an ecommerce brand. Scope fixed to cradle to gate, five-field sheet, two scenarios. Supplier B showed 22 percent lower climate impact due to recycled content and shorter transport. The brand switched suppliers the same week.

## Common Pitfalls And Quick Fixes

- Different functional units → define once, check quantities
- Missing transport in one scenario → add both inbound and outbound
- Mixed years/geographies → align or flag as sensitivity
- Only climate reported → add at least one more EF 3.1 category
- Import mapping mistakes → reuse a saved mapping profile and spot-check lines

## FAQ

**Can I compare three or more suppliers at once?**\
Yes. Add more scenarios with the same scope. Templates help avoid setup errors.

**Do I need ecoinvent for this?**\
Not necessarily. Start with EU Environmental Footprint; add ecoinvent if your product/region needs deeper coverage.

**What if one supplier refuses to share data?**\
Use a database proxy for that supplier and label it as secondary data. Note it in your decision.

**Can I include price and quality too?**\
Yes. Use a simple 2×2 chart (climate vs. price) separately from the LCA charts. Keep LCA assumptions documented.

## Why Use Sustainly For Supplier Comparisons

- Automation that maps columns and units fast
- AI-assisted process selection by region and technology
- Comparison view for side-by-side charts
- EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016 available without extra setup
- EN 15804 workflow if you need EPD-style outputs later
