> “Sustainability isn’t just a design choice anymore — it’s the core of Danish craftsmanship.”\
> 💬 _The shift from aesthetics to accountability is reshaping how furniture is made, sold, and certified._

## From Iconic Design to Data-Driven Sustainability

Denmark’s furniture industry — home to timeless design icons and new sustainable innovators — is experiencing a quiet revolution. With global demand for eco-certified products and stricter EU regulations like the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)**, furniture manufacturers are turning to **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** to prove and improve their environmental performance.

Small and mid-sized Danish companies are leading the charge, using LCA not just as a compliance exercise but as a **strategic design and export tool**.

## What Is an LCA in Furniture Manufacturing?

A **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** quantifies environmental impacts — from raw materials and transport to use and end-of-life — across a product’s entire life.

In furniture, LCAs help answer crucial questions:

- How much carbon comes from imported wood or upholstery?
- Is recycling aluminum legs better than sourcing new ones?
- Which finish or glue has the lowest environmental footprint?

> 💡 **Tip:** The most sustainable design isn’t always the one with the “greenest” material — it’s the one with the **lowest life-cycle impact** overall.
