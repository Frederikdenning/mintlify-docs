<Card title="CO2e assessment" icon="leaf" color="#87ed92" horizontal>
  Common starting point to size impact. Frequently relies on suboptimal data, such as spend data and carries a risk of carbon tunnel vision.
</Card>

<Card title="LCA assessment" icon="leaf" color="#87ed92" horizontal>
  Provides a more holistic view by analyzing impacts across multiple indicators, including effects on human health, the natural environment, and climate.

**ðŸ‘‰ Carbon tunnel vision:** focusing only on CO2e can miss other material impacts, such as biodiversity, water, health, and social inequality.

| **Feature**  | **COâ‚‚e Assessment** | **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**              |
| :----------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------: |
| Scope        | GHG emissions only  | Multi-indicator (health, biodiversity, etc.) |
| Data quality | Often spend-based   | Combines primary + database                  |
| Use case     | Quick footprint     | Detailed product analysis                    |

## Benefits of Full LCA Over COâ‚‚e

- **Multiâ€‘indicator view** across **human health**, **nature**, and **resource availability** (not just climate)
- **Higher data quality,** combining primary data with reputable LCA databases
- **Fair comparisons** using a **functional unit** (impact per use, not per item)
- **Operational insight**: clear **hotspots** in materials, processes, logistics, energy, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life
- **Credibility** for **declarations** and **public claims** aligned with standards

## Practical insight

Reducing material waste by even a few percentage points in manufacturing can lead to significant gains in:

- **Operational efficiency** â€“ less scrap, smoother workflows
- **Cost savings** â€“ lower input costs and waste management expenses
- **Environmental impact** â€“ reduced resource depletion and emissions

Small design or process changesâ€”guided by LCAâ€”can unlock measurable improvements across sustainability and profitability.
