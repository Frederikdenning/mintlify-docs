**Start with purpose** – clarify where LCA will bring the most value:

- **Marketing & sales support** – provide credible numbers to back claims
- **Product compliance & tenders** – meet regulatory or buyer requirements
- **R&D comparisons** – choose materials or processes with lower impact
- **Reporting** – support sustainability disclosures and metrics
- **Supply chain optimization** – find hotspots and reduce risk
