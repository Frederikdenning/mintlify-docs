## What is Life Cycle Assessment?

LCA is a standardized way to quantify a product's environmental impacts across its entire life. It turns complex data into clear choices you can act on. Less noise. More signal. Better products.

> Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) visualizes the **product journey from raw materials to end of life**, used to evaluate environmental and sustainability impacts.
>
> ðŸ‘‰ Raw materials â†’ Manufacturing â†’ Distribution â†’ Use â†’ End of life

### Key Questions LCA Answers:

- Where are the biggest hotspots across the value chain?
- Which materials, suppliers, or processes drive most of the impact?
- Whether a design change actually reduces total impact rather than shifting it elsewhere?
- How different product options compare on a fair, functional basis?
- What role use, maintenance, and endâ€‘ofâ€‘life play in the overall footprint?

### What LCA Delivers

- A clear hotspot map that shows where to focus effort first;
- Comparable results per unit that let you choose the better option;
- Input material for Environmental Product Declarations and customer requests;
- Evidence and narratives you can reuse across product, marketing, and sales.

### Core Elements of an LCA:

1. **Goal and scope** define why you are doing the study and how you will use the results.
2. [**Functional or declared unit**](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/units) sets the basis for comparison, for example 200 wears of a tâ€‘shirt or 1 kg of product.
3. **System boundary and cutâ€‘offs** decide which processes are included, for example packaging, transport, and recycling.
4. [**Data sources**](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/database) combine primary data from your operations with quality secondary data from LCA databases.
5. [**Impact assessment method**](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/methods) converts flows into indicators, for example EF 3.1, ReCiPe, or IPCC for climate.
6. [**Interpretation and quality checks**](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/addvalue) include hotspot analysis, sensitivity checks, uncertainty, and external review when needed.

## LCA Example: [Reusable vs. Single-Use Products](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/units)

Consider comparing a reusable cup to a single-use alternative. The reusable version may have a higher initial impact due to materials and manufacturing. But when used 200 times, cleaned efficiently, and actually reused, its **per-use impact** drops significantly.

**LCA makes this comparison fair** by:

- Normalizing impacts across a functional unit (e.g. 200 uses)
- Highlighting key variables like durability and cleaning method
- [Revealing trade-offs that arenâ€™t obvious from carbon alone](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/lca-vs-co2)

## Why LCA Matters in Sustainable Product Design?

Every product carries a hidden environmental footprintâ€”energy use, emissions, water consumption, toxicity, and resource depletion. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) reveals that footprint in a structured, comparable way, helping designers and sustainability teams make informed decisions beyond just carbon metrics.

## [How Businesses Use LCA for Compliance and Reporting?](https://learn.sustainly.ai/2.LCA-Guideline/addvalue)

- **Credible communication** for marketing and sales without greenwashing;
- **Design and R&D** to choose better materials, finishes, and suppliers early;
- **Procurement and tenders** where EPDs and comparable results are required;
- **Risk and compliance** as regulations and digital product data grow;
- **Reporting** with defensible, repeatable numbers your stakeholders can trust.
