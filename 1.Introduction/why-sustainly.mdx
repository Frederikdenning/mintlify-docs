- Traditional LCA tools often demand heavy expertise, long timelines, and complex setup. Many product teams and sustainability managers never adopt them because the barrier to entry is high.
- Meanwhile, regulatory pressures (e.g. EU CSRD, product carbon regulations), consumer demands, and climate risks require actionable, scalable, transparent environmental metrics.
- Sustainly exists to democratize credible LCA, making it accessible to teams who aren't full-time LCA experts, while still being rigorous enough for EPDs, comparative assessments, and corporate reporting.

## Core Pillars & Differentiators

Here's what sets Sustainly apart:

- _AI-enabled modeling at scale_\
  Use existing operational, material, and product data to auto-generate LCA models, scale across product lines, and iterate rapidly.
- AI co-pilot_Makes workflows much easierâ€”from selecting datasets to adding waste streams and updating metadata.
- Methodological robustness_Supports EF 3.1, IPCC 2021, ReCiPe 2016, and multiple allocation approaches.
- Dynamic database integration_Includes the EU Environmental Footprint database; supports Ecoinvent for higher granularity.
- EPD & PEF ready workflows_Generate EPD tables, maintain traceability, and manage EN 15804 compliance.
- Enterprise readiness & integrations_Multi-user collaboration, API endpoints, and PLM/ERP integrations.
- Data quality & transparency_Metadata maintenance, audits, and a single shared source of truth for trustworthy scaling.
