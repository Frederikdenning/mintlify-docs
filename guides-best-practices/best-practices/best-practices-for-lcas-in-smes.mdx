Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are under increasing pressure to measure and reduce their environmental impact — yet many lack the time, resources, or in-house expertise to run detailed assessments. **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** provides a structured way to understand product footprints, but historically it’s been difficult for small companies to adopt.

That’s now shifting. With accessible, AI-supported platforms like **Sustainly**, LCAs become faster, easier to understand, and far more practical — even for teams without sustainability specialists. Sustainly brings transparency, centralized sustainability data, and simple LCA tools for businesses looking to build sustainable business value from day one.

Below are five best practices every small company can follow to make LCAs both actionable and achievable.

## 1. Start Small, Think Big

Many SMEs delay LCAs because they expect a complex, heavy process. In reality, the most effective way to begin is to **choose one product or service**, collect core data, and expand over time.

Running a simple **screening LCA** with a transparent AI sustainability tool like Sustainly helps teams learn quickly, identify early hotspots, and build confidence before scaling to broader product lines.

> 💬 *The same applies to sustainability work: begin with clarity, grow with intention.*

<Tip>Start with your highest-volume or most resource-intensive product first — that’s where improvements pay off fastest.</Tip>

## 2. Use Digital Tools to Automate Data Collection

Manual data entry is often the single biggest bottleneck. Instead, small companies benefit from **automating repetitive tasks** like mapping materials, normalizing supplier data, or aligning units and categories.

Sustainly’s transparent AI assistant helps teams streamline data mapping and centralize sustainability data, reducing the time required to prepare an assessment while keeping everything auditable and consistent.

> 💡 **Tip:** Automation ensures consistency across future LCAs, making ongoing carbon footprint tracking for companies dramatically easier.

## 3. Prioritize Transparency Over Perfection

Perfect data shouldn’t be the barrier to getting started. LCAs are meant to guide better decisions, not to produce flawless datasets on day one. SMEs that share clear assumptions and highlight uncertainties build trust with stakeholders and suppliers.

Sustainly supports this approach by generating **clear, easy-to-share LCA documentation** and keeping project inputs organized in one place so teams can refine estimates collaboratively over time.

## 4. Integrate LCAs Into Everyday Decision-Making

An LCA shouldn’t be a static report. When integrated into daily workflows, it becomes a powerful tool for **design decisions, procurement choices, and product improvements**.

With centralized sustainability data and a shared company hub, platforms like Sustainly help cross-functional teams see the impact of design changes in real time — empowering both beginners and experts to contribute meaningfully.

> 💡 **Tip:** Treat your LCA dashboard as a living guide that evolves with your product, supply chain, and business strategy.

## 5. Choose Scalable, Easy-to-Use Software

Traditional LCA tools can be difficult for SMEs to adopt due to steep learning curves and resource requirements. Instead, look for **scalable sustainability workflows** that grow with your team, are fast to learn, and support structured, reusable data.

Sustainly offers intuitive workflows designed for both LCA beginners and seasoned practitioners, enabling SMEs to move from simple assessments to more detailed analyses without switching tools.
