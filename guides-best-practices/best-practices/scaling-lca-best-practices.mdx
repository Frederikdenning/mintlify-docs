## Why Scaling LCAs Is So Hard

Most sustainability teams start small — one LCA for one flagship product.  
But as organizations grow, that *one* turns into *hundreds* or *thousands* of products needing comparable environmental data.  

Without a scalable system, teams face:
- Weeks spent repeating manual data collection  
- Inconsistent models across analysts  
- Difficulty verifying or comparing results  

That’s why scaling LCAs isn’t just about *doing more* — it’s about **building a repeatable, automated process**.

---

## 1. Standardize Methods and Frameworks

Before scaling, consistency is everything.  
Different analysts using different methods (e.g., IPCC 2021 vs. ReCiPe 2016) will make portfolio comparisons meaningless.

Create a shared LCA framework for all team members: same databases, methods, and allocation rules.
</Callout>

**Best practice checklist:**
- Define one **impact method** (EF 3.1 or ReCiPe 2016).  
- Choose a consistent **allocation approach** (Cut-off or Consequential).  
- Set standardized **system boundaries** and **functional units**.  
- Document these choices in a central “LCA playbook.”

## 2. Automate Data Collection and Model Building

Manual LCAs don’t scale — automation does.

Sustainability teams waste enormous time gathering process data, matching suppliers, and entering logistics info manually.  
Modern AI tools like **Sustainly** automatically:
- Connect to **ERP or PLM systems**  
- Detect **product-level material compositions**  
- Suggest **matching background datasets**  
- Build **pre-verified LCA models** instantly

Automation doesn’t replace expertise — it amplifies it.

## 3. Centralize Data for Consistency

Scalability depends on *reusability*.  
When every LCA analyst starts from scratch, data chaos spreads quickly.

> 💡 **Tip:** Store all datasets, assumptions, and models in a shared, version-controlled database.  

| Element | Best Practice |
|----------|----------------|
| 📁 Project Templates | Pre-configure LCA goals, boundaries, and databases |
| 🔄 Version Control | Track model iterations and updates |
| 🧾 Data Governance | Assign roles for who can approve or modify datasets |

Sustainly provides this via **collaborative project workspaces** — ensuring everyone works on the same, validated data foundation.

## 4. Establish Quality Control Workflows

Scaling without control creates noise.  
Every LCA should undergo **peer review or verifier review**, even in automated contexts.

**Include these QA steps:**
1. Automated data consistency check.  
2. Peer or verifier validation (EN 15804, ISO 14044).  
3. Documentation of all assumptions and changes.  

> 🧠 The goal: *Each new LCA is faster — but never less credible.*

---

## 5. Communicate at Portfolio Level

Once your LCAs are scalable, insights should scale too.  
Don’t just show product-by-product impacts; visualize category averages or improvement trends.

**Best practice:**
- Use dashboards to track hotspots across product lines.  
- Benchmark materials, suppliers, or processes.  
- Integrate with ESG or EPD workflows for consistent public reporting.  

Sustainly includes **portfolio-level analytics** — transforming raw data into strategic sustainability insights.

## Common Pitfalls When Scaling LCAs

- ❌ Treating each LCA as a standalone project  
- ❌ Lacking documentation or version control  
- ❌ Relying on manual spreadsheets for modeling  
- ❌ Ignoring verifier review when scaling speed  

<Warning>Scaling fast without structure leads to inconsistent, unverifiable LCAs — and wasted effort.</Warning>

## Conclusion

Scaling LCAs isn’t just about capacity — it’s about **building an ecosystem of trust, transparency, and efficiency**.  
By combining automation with good data governance, sustainability teams can go from a handful of product LCAs to a complete, actionable footprint library.
