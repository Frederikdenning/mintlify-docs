**Primary data** makes your LCA more accurate, credible, and decision-ready.\
But collecting it can feel like herding cats — across suppliers, factories, and spreadsheets.

Here’s your how-to guide to get the data you need without frustration — especially for your **first LCA study**.

---

## Why Primary Data Matters

- 🌱 More accurate than database averages
- ✅ Required for EPDs and customer-facing reports
- 🔍 Helps identify real hotspots in your own processes
- 🏆 Adds credibility to sustainability claims

## Who to Ask (and What to Ask For)

| Source            | What to Request                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Internal factory  | Material input/output, energy, water, waste    |
| Supplier          | Transport modes, packaging, recycled content   |
| Logistics         | Shipping distances, load factors, return trips |
| Assembly partners | Assembly energy, scrap rates, equipment type   |

## 🛠️ Sample Data Table (for Suppliers)

| Parameter      | Value | Unit | Notes                   |
| -------------- | ----- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| Material input | 1,250 | kg   | Polymer resin           |
| Electricity    | 1,900 | kWh  | Annual total            |
| Transport      | 700   | km   | From plant to warehouse |
| Scrap rate     | 8     | %    | For injection molding   |

📌 _Pro tip_: Use consistent units (e.g. kg, kWh) and document the **year** and **source** for each entry.

## 5 Golden Rules of Primary Data Collection

1. **Start simple** — focus on top materials, energy, and transport
2. **Avoid perfectionism** — better to be roughly right than precisely missing
3. **Always include source & year** — no “anonymous Excel tabs”
4. **Ask for ranges, not just point values** (e.g. low/avg/high)
5. **Keep a clean audit trail** — version control is your friend

## Tools That Make It Easier

✅ Google Forms (quick collection from multiple suppliers)\
✅ Sustainly (AI helps fill gaps + flags missing units)\
✅ Excel with dropdowns for units and sources\
✅ SharePoint or Notion for centralized logs

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Sending 20-tab Excel monsters\
❌ Asking for data your supplier doesn’t have\
❌ Mixing data from different years without noting it\
❌ Forgetting unit conversions (m³ vs liters, MJ vs kWh)\
❌ Not following up — most suppliers won’t reply the first time

## Final Tip

The first LCA is always the hardest. The second is much easier — _if_ you keep your data structure clean from day one.
