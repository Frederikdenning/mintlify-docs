**Primary data** makes your LCA more accurate, credible, and genuinely decision-ready.\
But collecting it can feel like herding cats — suppliers, factories, and internal teams each hold small but crucial pieces of the puzzle.

This guide helps you structure your first data-collection process with clarity, confidence, and minimal chaos.

## Why Primary Data Matters

- 🌱 More accurate than generic databases
- 🔍 Helps identify real hotspots in your production or supply chain
- 🏆 Strengthens internal decision-making and customer trust
- 📈 Supports data-driven sustainability improvements

<Tip>
  Even partial primary data can dramatically improve your first assessment — don’t wait for perfection.

## Who to Ask (and What to Ask For)

| Source            | What to Request                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Internal factory  | Material inputs/outputs, energy, water, waste |
| Supplier          | Transport modes, packaging, recycled content  |
| Logistics         | Shipping distances, load factors              |
| Assembly partners | Assembly energy, scrap rates, equipment types |

Centralizing sustainability data from these groups makes future LCAs easier and helps teams collaborate around a shared foundation.

## 🛠️ Sample Data Table (for Suppliers)

| Parameter      | Value | Unit | Notes             |
| -------------- | ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| Material input | 1,250 | kg   | Polymer resin     |
| Electricity    | 1,900 | kWh  | Annual total      |
| Transport      | 700   | km   | Plant → warehouse |
| Scrap rate     | 8     | %    | Injection molding |

📌 _Pro tip:_ Use consistent units and always include the year and source. You’ll thank yourself later.

## 5 Golden Rules of Primary Data Collection

1. **Start simple** — focus on major materials, energy use, and transport first.
2. **Avoid perfectionism** — approximate values are better than no values.
3. **Document source & year** — avoid losing context in anonymous spreadsheets.
4. **Ask for ranges** — low/average/high values help reflect uncertainty.
5. **Keep a clean audit trail** — consistent naming and version control save hours.

## Tools That Make It Easier

- Google Forms or Typeform for supplier inputs
- Shared folders (Notion, SharePoint) for internal logs
- Excel sheets with dropdown fields for units

And for teams that want to streamline the entire workflow, **Sustainly** offers a transparent AI copilot that:

- Flags missing or inconsistent units
- Helps standardize materials across suppliers
- Organizes primary data in a centralized sustainability hub
- Supports both experts and beginners as they scale their assessments

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Sending massive, complex spreadsheets nobody understands\
❌ Requesting data suppliers don’t track\
❌ Mixing years without documenting the difference\
❌ Forgetting to standardize units\
❌ Assuming one email will get a reply — follow-up is essential

## Final Tip

Your **first LCA** is always the hardest. The second becomes dramatically easier when your data is structured, centralized, and easy to update — especially with transparent AI sustainability tools supporting your workflow.
