Turning an LCA into a **third-party verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)** is one of the most impactful ways to communicate your product’s environmental profile. While an LCA helps your team understand impacts internally, an EPD turns that work into **market-ready, standardized, and externally trusted documentation**.

This guide walks you through what it takes — from preparing your LCA to completing verification and publishing.

## What Is an EPD?

An EPD is a structured, independently verified document that summarizes a product’s environmental impacts in a consistent, comparable format. It is built on top of your LCA but applies **strict reporting rules**, ensuring that buyers, regulators, and auditors can interpret your results with confidence.

EPDs are widely used in construction, consumer products, packaging, and public procurement because they offer:

- A harmonized communication format  
- A standardized data structure  
- Transparency around assumptions, boundaries, and data sources  

For many organizations, an EPD is not just a sustainability deliverable — it becomes a competitive advantage.

A strong EPD builds trust by showing not just *what* your product’s footprint is, but *how* it was calculated.

## Step 1: Finalize a High-Quality, Well-Documented LCA

Before you begin the EPD process, your LCA must be:

- **Complete** — covering the required life cycle stages for your product category  
- **Transparent** — with assumptions, data sources, and boundaries clearly recorded  
- **Consistent** — using a functional unit and system description aligned with reporting rules  
- **Traceable** — with a clear audit trail for primary data and modelling choices  

This is where accessible, data-driven sustainability tools help. Sustainly’s structured workflows make it easier for teams to build LCAs with:

- Centralized sustainability data  
- AI-assisted input checks  
- Aligned assumptions across departments  
- Clear, shareable documentation  

These foundations reduce verification delays later.

## Step 2: Identify the Correct Product Category Rules (PCR)

Every EPD must follow a **PCR**, which defines how your product type should be modeled, which impacts to report, and how results must be formatted.

PCRs typically cover:

- The required life cycle stages  
- Functional unit rules  
- Reporting requirements  
- Any product-specific modeling considerations  

Choosing the wrong PCR can cause rework — or even make your submission invalid — so invest time here to get it right.

## Step 3: Prepare Your Documentation Package

Before verification, you’ll assemble a complete set of materials that explain your LCA and justify your results. A typical package includes:

- A detailed LCA report with methodology and data sources  
- A draft EPD formatted according to the PCR  
- Impact tables and data summaries  
- A clear interpretation section explaining the “why” behind results  
- Assumptions on end-of-life, allocations, and scenarios  

This preparation phase is where teams often experience delays. Using a centralized sustainability platform helps avoid inconsistent data, missing units, or undocumented assumptions.

## Step 4: Undergo Independent Verification

A verifier is an independent expert who checks:

- Whether your modelling aligns with the PCR  
- Whether your assumptions are reasonable and well-documented  
- Whether the LCA results are technically sound  
- Whether your EPD report meets all formatting and disclosure requirements  

Verification often includes iterative feedback rounds. Being well-organized — especially with clear version control — shortens this process dramatically.

Sustainly supports this step by helping teams keep all data, assumptions, and calculations accessible in one place, so reviewers can follow the logic without guesswork.

---

## Step 5: Publish in an Official EPD Program

Once verified, your EPD is submitted to an official program for publication. Programs typically:

- Perform a compliance check  
- Assign a registration number  
- Publish the document publicly  
- Host your EPD for a defined validity period  

Once published, your EPD becomes a recognized, standardized statement of your product’s environmental profile that can be used in procurement, customer communication, and sustainability reporting.

## Typical Timeline & Effort

| Step               | Time Estimate |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| LCA finalization   | 2–4 weeks     |
| PCR matching       | ~1 week       |
| EPD drafting       | 1–2 weeks     |
| Verification rounds| 2–3 weeks     |
| Publication        | 1–2 weeks     |

These timelines vary by product complexity, data availability, and verification readiness.

## Final Takeaway

A verified EPD transforms your LCA from an internal analysis to a **trusted, market-facing product declaration**. It strengthens credibility, supports compliance, and opens doors in markets where environmental transparency is increasingly required.

Data-driven sustainability platforms like Sustainly help teams move through this journey efficiently by providing:

- AI-assisted modeling support  
- Centralized sustainability data  
- Reusable templates for consistent reporting  
- Collaboration features for cross-department alignment  

By pairing strong LCA work with the right workflow, getting to a verified EPD becomes clearer, faster, and more accessible — whether you're a sustainability expert or just beginning.
