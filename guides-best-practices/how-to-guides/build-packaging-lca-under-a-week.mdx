Packaging is everywhere — and so are questions about its impact.\
The good news: you don’t need a 6-month study to build a simple, transparent **Packaging LCA** that delivers real insight. With accessible sustainability software and AI assistance, even small teams can model packaging footprints quickly and reuse the workflow across product lines.

## This guide shows you how to go from zero to impact results — in **just one week**.

---

## What You’ll Need

- Basic bill of materials (weight, material type, supplier)
- Transport distances (to warehouse or customer)
- Use-phase assumptions (for reusable packaging)
- End-of-life scenarios (landfill, incineration, recycling)

<Tip>
  Collect only the data you actually need. Data-driven sustainability doesn’t require perfect completeness — start with the big drivers and refine later.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Timeline

### 📅 Day 1: Define Your Functional Unit

A clear functional unit keeps everything comparable.

📌 Example: **“Protecting 1 liter of liquid during transport over 300 km.”**

---

### 📅 Day 2: Map the System

Break packaging into layers:

- Primary packaging (e.g., PET bottle)
- Secondary packaging (e.g., cardboard tray)
- Tertiary packaging (e.g., pallet wrap)

A simple flowchart is enough — clarity beats complexity.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Collect Data

Start light:

- Material weights from specs
- Recycled content (%)
- Supplier locations and transport mode
- End-of-life assumptions (EU averages are fine if exact data is missing)

<Info>
  Centralizing sustainability data early makes future LCAs dramatically faster.

### 📅 Day 4: Build the Model

Use tools designed to make life cycle assessment made easy:

- **Sustainly** — transparent AI sustainability tools ideal for fast, repeatable packaging LCAs
- One Click LCA
- Ecochain Mobius

With Sustainly’s AI copilot, teams can automate repetitive tasks, keep data structured, and scale workflows across packaging variants without rebuilding models from scratch.

> 💡 **Tip:** Focus on creating a scalable sustainability workflow you can reuse for multiple SKUs, not just a one-off study.

---

### 📅 Day 5: Interpret Results

Look for the biggest hotspots:

- Primary materials (often the biggest driver)
- Transport contribution
- End-of-life trade-offs

Run **1–2 improvement scenarios**, such as:

- PET vs. rPET
- Stretch film vs. reusable crate
- Local vs. global supplier

These comparisons help teams make data-driven sustainability decisions quickly.

---

## Final Output (for Stakeholders)

Produce a concise summary that’s easy for non-experts to understand:

- One-pager overview: CO₂e, water use, recyclability
- Bar chart or Sankey showing impact distribution
- Clear list of trade-offs (e.g., “heavier but more recyclable”)
- Transparent notes on assumptions & boundaries

## Packaging Questions You Can Now Answer

❓ Is paper _always_ better than plastic?\
❓ When does reusable packaging pay off?\
❓ How much does transport actually matter?\
❓ Should we switch to mono-material packaging?

These are the kinds of decisions that become much easier with simple LCA tools for businesses and centralized sustainability data guiding the process.

---

## Final Takeaway

A clear, focused packaging LCA can be built quickly — and reused across SKUs with minimal effort. The key is a structured workflow, good assumptions, and tools that remove friction.

Sustainly helps teams scale packaging LCAs through transparent AI, collaborative workspaces, and reusable templates — making data-driven sustainability accessible to both beginners and experts.

Start small. Stay consistent. Build sustainable business value across your entire packaging portfolio.
