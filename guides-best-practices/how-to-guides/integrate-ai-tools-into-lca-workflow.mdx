Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way LCAs are performed — reducing manual work, improving data quality, and uncovering insights faster.

## Why Integrate AI into LCA?

Traditional LCAs are often time-consuming due to data collection, database matching, and sensitivity analysis. AI can automate these repetitive tasks, letting sustainability teams focus on strategy and innovation.

## Use Cases of AI in LCA

1. **Automated Data Mapping** – AI systems can match materials or processes to LCI databases in seconds.
2. **Hotspot Identification** – Machine learning models highlight key impact areas across the product life cycle.
3. **Scenario Simulation** – Predict the impact of material substitutions or design changes instantly.
4. **Natural Language Summaries** – AI can summarize technical findings into plain-language reports.

## Best Tools to Get Started

- **Sustainly AI Assistant** – for data enrichment and automated LCI matching
- **OpenLCA + ML Extensions** – open-source integration for machine learning-based modeling
- **Brightway2** – Python-based framework supporting AI experimentation
