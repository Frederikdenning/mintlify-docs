Defining the **functional unit** and **system boundaries** is the foundation of any credible Life Cycle Assessment. These choices determine how your product is evaluated, how results scale, and whether comparisons are meaningful. For new practitioners, this step often feels abstract — but once you understand the logic, your entire workflow becomes clearer and far easier to communicate.

Sustainly helps guide this process by pairing transparent AI with structured, intuitive project setup screens. This keeps decisions consistent across teams and ensures every LCA starts with a solid methodological base.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

A functional unit and system boundary tell your audience two essential things:

1. **What function you are assessing**, and  
2. **How far across the lifecycle the analysis goes**.

If either is vague or incomplete, the credibility of the entire assessment suffers. Clear definitions make downstream modeling easier, ensure assumptions are shared consistently across teams, and make results more comparable across products.

Strong foundations lead to stronger insights — and a far smoother path to decisions, reporting, or verification.

## ✅ What They Mean

### **Functional Unit (FU)**  
The FU defines *the service your product delivers*, expressed in measurable terms. All material inputs, emissions, and results are scaled to this unit.

Examples:

- “1 liter of beverage delivered to the consumer”  
- “Lighting a room for 1,000 hours”  
- “Transporting 1 tonne of goods over 100 km”  

### **System Boundaries**  
These boundaries define *which life-cycle stages are included*. Typical options:

- **Cradle-to-Gate** — raw materials to finished product  
- **Cradle-to-Grave** — full lifecycle including use and disposal  
- **Gate-to-Gate** — a single manufacturing step  
- **Custom** — tailored boundaries for unique studies  

<Tip>Clear boundaries help teams avoid hidden assumptions and keep comparisons fair and meaningful.</Tip>

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: Defining FU & Boundaries in Sustainly

### Step 1: Clarify Your Goal & Scope

Start by articulating why you are running the LCA:

- Are you comparing products?  
- Supporting design decisions?  
- Creating documentation for customers or procurement?  
- Building toward an internal footprint database?

These questions determine how broad your boundary should be and how precise your functional unit must become.

---

### Step 2: Define the Functional Unit

A strong FU follows three principles:

1. **It describes the product’s core function.**  
2. **It is quantifiable.**  
3. **It remains consistent when comparing alternatives.**

In Sustainly, you set this under **Project Settings → Functional Unit**, where AI prompts help refine vague or inconsistent definitions.

<Info>
Avoid generic units like “1 product.” Instead, anchor your FU to the real service your product provides.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Select System Boundaries

In Sustainly, choose a boundary template or define your own. Then consider which stages materially change your results:

- Material sourcing  
- Manufacturing steps  
- Distribution  
- Use-phase behaviour  
- End-of-life pathways  

A well-structured boundary ensures your model reflects how the product is actually used in the real world.

<Warning>
Leaving out important stages — such as use-phase for energy-intensive products — can distort results and reduce credibility.
</Warning>

---

### Step 4: Map Processes Inside the Boundary

Once your FU and boundaries are set, Sustainly helps build the internal structure of your model:

- Suggested processes based on product type  
- Automatic grouping of materials and operations  
- Clear visibility into what’s included or excluded  
- Centralized sustainability data so teams work from the same assumptions  

Each adjustment updates the model immediately, making it easier to see the effect of expansions, exclusions, or alternative pathways.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ Guided Setup           | AI prompts help structure your lifecycle stages             |
| 🧱 Customizable Scope     | Adjust boundaries at any time in the project               |
| 🌍 Full Transparency      | Every inclusion/exclusion is recorded for reporting        |

### Step 5: Validate and Document

Before generating an output, review:

- Does the FU capture the real service delivered?  
- Are boundaries justified and aligned with your goal?  
- Are all processes scaled correctly?  

Sustainly’s internal checks flag inconsistencies so you can correct them before exporting results or sharing with a reviewer.

<Info>
Sustainly automatically embeds FU and boundary definitions into your project documentation, ensuring consistency across teams.

## 🧩 Example Scenario: Stainless-Steel Bottle

| Step               | Choice                          | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Functional Unit | 1 bottle delivering 500 refills | Focuses on hydration over repeated use              |
| 🔲 Boundary        | Cradle-to-Grave                 | Includes production, washing, and end-of-life       |
| 🧠 Focus Area      | Durability & reuse cycles       | Highlights where circular decisions matter           |

Inside Sustainly, this setup helps compare reusable bottles with single-use alternatives on an equal basis — aligned functional units and shared boundaries make the comparison robust and decision-ready.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Using “1 unit produced” as FU when products serve different functions  
- Forgetting to rescale flows after changing the FU  
- Excluding major lifecycle stages without justification  
- Applying inconsistent boundaries across comparative studies  
- Keeping assumptions scattered across documents instead of centralized  

<Warning>
Reviewers and stakeholders look for clear boundaries first — ambiguity here leads to questions later.
</Warning>

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I adjust the FU later?**  
Yes — Sustainly recalculates everything automatically once the FU changes.

**What if I don’t know the full lifecycle?**  
Start with a simple boundary and iterate. Sustainly highlights missing or unclear stages as you build.

**Is Cradle-to-Grave always the best choice?**  
Not necessarily. The “right” boundary depends entirely on your study’s goal and decision context.
