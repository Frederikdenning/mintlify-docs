## 🧠 Why this matters

A common question on Reddit’s [r/lifecycleassessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifecycleassessment) community goes something like this:

> “I can’t seem to grasp anything beyond the basics of goal, scope, FU, and system boundaries.”

You’re not alone. Many new LCA practitioners struggle with defining the **functional unit (FU)** and **system boundaries**, and yet — these two decisions are what make or break the credibility of your assessment.

With **Sustainly**, defining these parameters becomes intuitive, guided, and fully transparent.

---

## ✅ What They Mean

**Functional Unit (FU):**\
The _reference unit_ for your study — it quantifies the function of your product or service. Every input, emission, and impact will relate to this unit.

**System Boundaries:**\
The _extent_ of your assessment — it defines which life-cycle stages (and processes) are included or excluded. Examples:

- Cradle-to-Gate (raw materials to factory gate)
- Cradle-to-Grave (raw materials to end-of-life)
- Gate-to-Gate (one specific process step)

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: Defining FU & Boundaries in Sustainly

### Step 1: Clarify Goal & Scope

In **Sustainly**, start by creating a new project and selecting your goal: _Product LCA, EPD, or Comparison_.\
Ask:

- What question am I trying to answer?
- Who will use these results?
- What decision will they support?

> 💡 **Example:** If you’re comparing reusable vs. disposable cups, your goal is a _comparative LCA_ — your FU should reflect _the service of delivering a single drink_.

---

### Step 2: Define the Functional Unit

1. Identify the product’s function (e.g., “store water,” “transport 1 ton km,” “light a room for 1000 hours”).
2. Quantify it using measurable terms.
3. In Sustainly: under **Project Settings → Functional Unit**, input your definition.
4. Keep it _comparable_ — two studies can only be compared if their FUs are identical in scope and meaning.

<Info>
  💡 Tip: Avoid vague units like “1 item” or “1 unit produced.” Be specific and measurable.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Select System Boundaries

Within Sustainly’s project setup, go to **System Boundary** and choose one of the templates:

- Cradle-to-Gate
- Cradle-to-Grave
- Gate-to-Gate
- Custom boundary (for specific processes)

Then, verify which stages matter most for your study:

- Material extraction
- Manufacturing
- Transport
- Use phase
- End-of-life (recycling, landfill, reuse)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Excluding major life-cycle stages (e.g., use phase for energy-consuming products) can drastically bias your results.

---

### Step 4: Map the Processes Inside Your Boundary

Sustainly’s AI automatically builds your process network.\
You can:

- Add or exclude manufacturing steps
- Link datasets from **EU Environmental Footprint** or **ecoinvent**
- Define recycling loops and allocation methods (Cut-off, Consequential, EN 15804)

All changes update your model in real-time, so you can immediately see their impact.

| Feature                    | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ Automated Mapping        | AI links your flows to verified datasets |
| 🧱 Customizable Boundaries | Adjust scope at any stage                |
| 🌍 Transparent Data        | Every inclusion/exclusion is documented  |

---

### Step 5: Validate and Document

When you hit “Calculate,” Sustainly runs a consistency check:

- Does your FU align with system boundaries?
- Are excluded processes justified?
- Are all flows correctly scaled to your FU?

Before exporting your report:

- Include the FU definition (e.g., _“1 kg of product delivered and used for 5 years”_)
- State the boundary (_“Cradle-to-Grave including raw material extraction, manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal”_)

<Info>
  Sustainly automatically embeds your FU and boundary definitions into your EPD export, ensuring verifier-ready transparency.

## 🧩 Example Scenario

**Case:** A reusable stainless-steel bottle

| Step               | Choice                          | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Functional Unit | 1 bottle delivering 500 refills | Defines service of hydration                        |
| 🔲 Boundary        | Cradle-to-Grave                 | Includes production, use (washing), and end-of-life |
| 🧠 Allocation      | EN 15804 Cut-off                | Accounts for recycling credit                       |

In Sustainly, you’d:

1. Create a new “Product LCA” project
2. Set FU = “1 bottle over 500 uses”
3. Select “Cradle-to-Grave” boundary
4. Import stainless steel data (from ecoinvent)
5. Add a washing use-phase process
6. Run calculation — results compare to single-use bottles instantly.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Using “1 unit” as FU when products differ in size or service.
- Forgetting to update model scaling when FU changes.
- Ignoring use-phase or disposal stages.
- Excluding processes without justification.
- Failing to document assumptions in the report.

<Warning>
  Always justify exclusions — reviewers look for this first in LCA reports.
</Warning>

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I change FU after building my model?**\
Yes. Sustainly lets you update the FU anytime — just rerun the calculation to rescale flows.

**What if I don’t know all lifecycle stages?**\
Use Sustainly’s AI suggestions or proxy data from built-in databases. It highlights missing stages so your model stays credible.

**Is Cradle-to-Grave always better?**\
Not always — it depends on your study goal. A Cradle-to-Gate boundary may be enough for supplier comparisons or EPDs.

## 🌍 Conclusion

Choosing the right **functional unit** and **system boundaries** is the foundation of every trustworthy LCA.\
With **Sustainly**, you’re not guessing — the platform guides you with automated suggestions, transparency checks, and instant documentation.

Start your next project with clarity:\
Define your function, set your boundary, and let Sustainly handle the complexity.
