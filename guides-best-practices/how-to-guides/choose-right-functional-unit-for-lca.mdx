Choosing the right **functional unit** is one of the most critical steps in any Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It defines _what exactly you are assessing_ and ensures that your results are both accurate and comparable.

## What Is a Functional Unit?

A **functional unit** represents the quantified performance of a product system — for example, “1 kg of packaging delivered to the customer” or “1 kWh of electricity produced.”\
It serves as the reference point for all environmental impacts in the LCA.

## Why It Matters

Without a clearly defined functional unit, your LCA can become inconsistent or misleading. It affects how data is collected, normalized, and interpreted, influencing every stage of the analysis.

## How to Define It Step-by-Step

1. **Start with the goal of your study** – Identify whether you’re comparing products, improving a process, or assessing a single system.
2. **Describe the product’s main function** – e.g., “containment” for packaging, “transport” for vehicles.
3. **Quantify the function** – Specify measurable units (e.g., per liter, per kilometer).
4. **Ensure comparability** – When comparing alternatives, all must serve the _same functional purpose_.
5. **Align with ISO standards** – Use ISO 14044 guidelines to maintain consistency.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using a vague or subjective definition (e.g., “a typical bottle”)
- Forgetting to normalize performance across compared systems
- Ignoring service life or durability in long-term assessments
