Choosing the right **functional unit** is one of the most important choices you’ll make in any Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It defines _what exactly is being evaluated_, anchors every data point, and ensures your results are both credible and comparable across products or scenarios. When chosen well, the functional unit becomes the foundation for data-driven sustainability decisions.

## What Is a Functional Unit?

A **functional unit** represents the quantified performance of a product system — for example:

- “1 liter of beverage delivered to the consumer,”
- “1 kWh of electricity produced,”
- “Transporting 1 pallet over 500 km.”

It becomes the reference point for all environmental impacts and ensures that sustainability metrics are always tied to a clear, measurable function.

  A well-defined functional unit makes life cycle assessment made easy — especially when your data and assumptions stay consistent across projects.

## Why It Matters

A vague or inconsistent functional unit can lead to unreliable conclusions. It influences:

- How data is collected and normalized
- How different materials or suppliers are compared
- Which scenarios are meaningful
- How stakeholders interpret your results

When LCAs are used to guide product design or procurement, this clarity becomes essential for sustainable business value.

## How to Define It Step-by-Step

1. **Start with the goal of your study**\
   Are you comparing alternatives, improving a single system, or supporting sustainability reporting?
2. **Describe the product’s core function**\
   Packaging “protects,” transport systems “move,” textiles “cover,” etc.
3. **Quantify the function**\
   Anchor it to a measurable unit (e.g., per liter, per kilometer, per wash cycle).
4. **Ensure comparability**\
   When comparing options, each system must deliver the _same_ functional performance.
5. **Be explicit about assumptions**\
   Service life, durability, and usage patterns often shift results more than materials.
6. **Align with recognized guidance**\
   Follow widely accepted methodological principles to maintain consistency and auditability.

<Tip>
  Write your functional unit before collecting data — it prevents unnecessary work and keeps your sustainability analysis focused.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Defining a functional unit that is vague or subjective
- Comparing products that do not deliver the same function
- Ignoring lifespan, durability, or intensity of use
- Allowing marketing claims to dictate functional performance
- Forgetting to document assumptions clearly
