# **Overview**

This guide provides an advanced introduction to Sustainly's component-based modeling. We will move beyond a single product to build a **reusable component library** for a modular table.

🌟A Note for Beginners: This tutorial assumes you understand foundational LCA concepts. We will focus on Sustainly's unique workflow for modeling complex products with interchangeable parts. This component-based method is the key to eliminating repetitive work and enabling rapid, iterative product design. If you’re new to LCA and Sustainly, we recommend you first read **Building Your First LCA Model with Sustainly.**

Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be proficient in:

- **Constructing a component library** with single, reusable “building blocks”.
- **Assembling a full cradle-to-cradle product** by combining components from your component library.
- **Running instant scenario analyses** by swapping components (e.g., steel legs vs. wood legs) to see immediate impact differences.

## **Project Goal & Scope**

Before we begin modeling, let’s clearly define the goal and scope. Our goal is not to model one product, but to build a component library that can create _three_ product variations, and with potential to be reused in other projects.

- **Goal:** To build a reusable component library to quantify and compare the full cradle-to-cradle environmental impacts of a modular table, offered in three design scenarios (steel, wood, or aluminum legs).
- **Functional Unit:** One complete modular table with 15 years of lifespan.
- **System Boundaries:** Cradle-to-cradle.

### **Product Scenarios to be Modeled**

|          | **Scenario 1: Steel Table** | **Scenario 2: Wood Table** | **Scenario 3: Aluminum Table** |
| :------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Top**  | Table top - Wood            | Table top - Wood           | Table top - Wood               |
| **Legs** | Table legs - Steel (x4)     | Table legs - Wood (x4)     | Table legs - Aluminum (x4)     |

# **Step-by-Step Modeling**

This section outlines the precise steps for building the component library and assembling the final products.

## 1. Construct the Component Library

### **1.1 Define the Component Library**

First, navigate to the **Components** panel in Sustainly. Instead of modeling a "Product" directly, we will first create all the "building blocks" we need. This is our master list:

![1 Pn](/images/1.png)

| **Component Name**                       | **Scope** | **Functional Unit** |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| **Table top - Wood**                     | A1-A3     | 1 item              |
| **Table legs - Steel**                   | A1-A3     | 1 item              |
| **Table legs - Wood**                    | A1-A3     | 1 item              |
| **Table legs - Aluminum**                | A1-A3     | 1 item              |
| **Transport - Shipping**                 | A4        | 1 tkm               |
| **Transport - Lorry**                    | A4        | 1 tkm               |
| **Eol - Steel (recycling and landfill)** | C+D       | 1 kg                |
| **Eol - Wood (energy recovery)**         | C+D       | 1 kg                |
| **Eol - Aluminium (recycling)**          | C+D       | 1 kg                |

### **1.2 Building a Manufacturing Component**

A component is a "recipe" of processes. We will encapsulate this recipe once, so we never have to build it again.

1. In the **Components** panel, click "Add component."
2. Name it **Table top - oak pattern** with the Functional Unit **1 item**.
3. In the **Kanban View**, build the following A1-A3 inventory as follows:

   ![2 Pn](/images/2.png)
1. **Save** the component. You have now encapsulated the full cradle-to-gate impact of a tabletop.
2. **Repeat** this process for the other three A1-A3 components: **Table legs - Steel**, **Table legs - Wood**, and **Table legs - Aluminum**, using their respective inventories.

### **1.3 Building a Transportation Component**

This component will model the impact of transportation. Unlike a manufactured part, we will create a scalable **unit component** (the impact of 1 kg\*km) that we can multiply at the product level.

1. In the **Components** panel, click "**Add component**."
2. Name it **Transport - lorry** with the Functional Unit **1 metric kg\*km**.
3. In the **Kanban View**, build the following A4 inventory as shown in the screenshot:

   ![3 Pn](/images/3.png)
4. **Save** the component. You have now encapsulated the environmental impact for moving **1 kilogram** of goods **1 kilometer** by truck.

**Repeat** this process for **Transport - shipping**, using the appropriate dataset for sea freight transportion.

### **1.4 Building an End-of-Life and Recycling Component**

This component will model the burdens (C-stages) and benefits (D-stage) of disposal.

1. In the **Components** panel, click "Add component."
2. Name it **Eol - Aluminium** with the Functional Unit **1 kg**.
3. In the **List View**, build the inventory for a 90% recycling, 10% incineration scenario:

   ![4 Pn](/images/4.png)
4. **Save** the component. The **negative quantity** in Module D represents the _avoided_ production of primary aluminum, giving a powerful environmental credit.

**Repeat** this process for **Eol - Steel** and **Eol - Wood**, using their specific scenarios.

## **2. Assembling the Product with Components**

Now for the payoff. We will assemble a product from our new component library.

1. Navigate to the **Products** panel in Sustainly.
2. Click the “Add product” button and name it **Table - Wooden top with steel legs**.
3. In the **Kanban View**, you can add the process with the **components** we just built:

   ![5 Pn](/images/5.png)
   

   ![6 Pn](/images/6.png)

Sustainly now automatically links all the complex inventories from your components to create the full life cycle.

## **3. Instant Comparison: Adding Scenarios**

This is where the power of component-based LCA becomes clear. Instead of duplicating the entire product, we will use Sustainly's scenario feature to create variations within the same product.

Let's assume your "Table - Steel Legs" product is your baseline, **S1 - steel legs**.

1. **Create New Scenarios:** Click the scenario dropdown menu at the top of the screen (as shown in the image).
   - Type **S2 - wooden legs** and press Enter to create a new scenario. This new scenario (S2) will start as a duplicate of S1.

   ![7 Pn](/images/7.png)
2. **Refine the Model:** With **S2 - wooden legs** selected, go to the **List View**. Make the following swaps:
   - **Remove:** `Table legs - Steel`
     - **Add:** `Table legs - Wood`
   - **Remove:** `Eol - Steel legs (recycling)`
     - **Add:** `Eol - Wood legs (energy recovery)`

   ![8 Pn](/images/8.png)
3. **Action:** Repeat this process to create the aluminum version.
   - Go back to the scenario dropdown.
   - Type **S3 - Aluminium legs** and press Enter. This will also be a copy of S1.
   - In the **List View** for S3, swap out the steel components for `Table legs - Aluminum, anodized` and `Eol - Aluminium legs (recycling)`, and adjust the transport weight.

### **4. Viewing the Results**

Click the **“Result view”** button. You can now select and compare all three scenarios (S1, S2, and S3) side-by-side. You have successfully created three complete, cradle-to-cradle LCAs in a fraction of the time, all by leveraging your reusable component library.
